abstract = {The aesthetic appreciation of a picture largely depends on the perceptual balance of its elements. The underlying mental mechanisms of this relation, however, are still poorly understood. For investigating these mechanisms, objective measures of balance have been constructed, such as the Assessment of Preference for Balance (APB) score of Wilson and Chatterjee (2005). In the present study we examined the APB measure and compared it to an alternative measure (DCM; Deviation of the Center of "Mass") that represents the center of perceptual "mass" in a picture and its deviation from the geometric center. Additionally, we applied measures of homogeneity and of mirror symmetry. In a first experiment participants had to rate the balance and symmetry of simple pictures, whereas in a second experiment different participants rated their preference (liking) for these pictures. In a third experiment participants rated the balance as well as the preference of new pictures. Altogether, the results show that DCM scores accounted better for balance ratings than APB scores, whereas the opposite held with respect to preference. Detailed analyses revealed that these results were due to the fact that aesthetic preference does not only depend on balance but also on homogeneity, and that the APB measure takes this feature into account.},

abstract = {Humans in societies around the world discriminate between potential mates on the basis of attractiveness in ways that can dramatically affect their lives. From an evolutionary perspective, a reasonable working hypothesis is that the psychological mechanisms underlying attractiveness judgments are adaptations that have evolved in the service of choosing a mate so as to increase gene propagation throughout evolutionary history. The main hypothesis that has directed evolutionary psychology research into facial attractiveness is that these judgments reflect information about what can be broadly defined as an individual's health. This has been investigated by examining whether attractiveness judgments show special design for detecting cues that allow us to make assessments of overall phenotypic condition. This review examines the three major lines of research that have been pursued in order to answer the question of whether attractiveness reflects non-obvious indicators of phenotypic condition. These are studies that have examined facial symmetry, averageness, and secondary sex characteristics as hormone markers.},

abstract = {The ability to cope adaptively with emotional events by volitionally altering one's emotional reactions is important for psychological and physical health as well as social interaction. Cognitive regulation of emotional responses to aversive events engages prefrontal regions that modulate activity in emotion-processing regions such as the amygdala. However, the neural correlates of the regulation of positive emotions remain largely unexplored. We used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine the neural correlates of cognitively increasing and decreasing emotional reactions to positive and negative stimuli. Participants viewed negative, positive, and neutral pictures while attempting to increase, decrease, or not alter their emotional reactions. Subjective reactions were assessed via on-line ratings. Consistent with previous studies, increasing negative and positive emotion engaged primarily left-lateralized prefrontal regions, whereas decreasing emotion activated bilateral prefrontal regions. Different activations unique to increasing versus decreasing emotion were observed for positive and negative stimuli: Unique increase-related activations were observed only for positive stimuli, whereas unique decrease-related activations were observed only for negative stimuli. Regulation also modulated activity in the amygdala, a key emotion-processing region. Regulation effects on amygdala activity were larger for positive than for negative stimuli, potentially reflecting a greater malleability of positive emotional reactions. Increasing and decreasing positive and negative emotion can thus increase and decrease subjective reactions and associated amygdala activity in line with regulatory goals, and is associated with different patterns of prefrontal activation as a function of emotional valence and regulatory goal.},

abstract = {In four independent studies, sex differences in cortisol responses to psychological stress were investigated in healthy adolescents and adults (total n = 153). Public speaking and mental arithmetic in front of an audience (Studies 1-3) reliably induced increases in free cortisol levels in both sexes with 2- to 4-fold increases above baseline levels. Mean cortisol responses were 1.5- to 2-fold higher in men compared with women. In Study 3, cortisol profiles were additionally investigated after human corticotropin-releasing hormone (h-CRH) and bicycle ergometry until exhaustion. Here, both sexes showed very similar adrenocortical responses. Furthermore, men showed elevated cortisol levels in anticipation of the psychological stress situation without actually having to perform the tasks (Study 4). Under this condition cortisol concentration was unchanged or decreased in women. From these data we conclude that the observed sex difference does not reflect an overall lower responsiveness of the female adrenal cortex. Although these studies do not provide conclusive data, we suggest sex differences in cognitive and/or emotional responses to distressing psychosocial situations which in turn may influence cortisol secretion.},

abstract = {The advent of the smartphone has dramatically altered how we communicate, navigate, work and entertain ourselves. While the advantages of this new technology are clear, constant use may also bring negative consequences, such as a loss of productivity due to interruptions in work life. A link between smartphone overuse and loss of productivity has often been hypothesized, but empirical evidence on this question is scarce. The present study addressed this question by collecting self-report data from N = 262 participants, assessing private and work-related smartphone use, smartphone addiction and self-rated productivity. Our results indicate a moderate relationship between smartphone addiction and a self-reported decrease in productivity due to spending time on the smartphone during work, as well as with the number of work hours lost to smartphone use. Smartphone addiction was also related to a greater amount of leisure time spent on the smartphone and was strongly related to a negative impact of smartphone use on daily non-work related activities. These data support the idea that tendencies towards smartphone addiction and overt checking of the smartphone could result in less productivity both in the workplace and at home. Results are discussed in relation to productivity and technostress.},

Attaining difficult goals might require a supportive relationship between the individual trying to obtain the goal and his/her supervisor. Studies that have examined this relationship to date have been correlational. The study uses an experimental method to examine the supportiveness of a supervisor on the goal achievement of a subordinate. This study was conducted in a lab setting due to ethical considerations. The participants in this study were 90 college students (44 males and 46 females, age ranged from 18 to 24). The participants were assigned at random to one of six conditions. The design for this experiment was a 2 x 3 factorial. The factors were supportive or nonsupportive and assigned, participative, and do your best (goal-setting conditions). Goal-setting was held constant between assigned and participative goal-setting conditions.

Results indicate that supportive behavior to higher goals being set and goals set through the participation route led to better performance than assigned goals. Participation appears to play an important role in understanding the task that is required of the individuals that set goals.},

abstract = {The future time perspective is described first in its relationship to learning and to motivation. The cognitive elaboration of human needs in plans, projects, and tasks is emphasized, and it is shown that the future time perspective in men is to be studied with regard to these plans, aspirations, and tasks. The results of two research programs are summarized: 1) The depth of time perspective in which the motivational objects of different categories of subjects are located is investigated in a cross-cultural study. 2) In a series of experiments on learning the influence of a future time perspective with regard to the response given is investigated in “open” and “closed” tasks. On the basis of these results some hypotheses on learning and behavior with regard to motivational and cognitive processes are proposed. Learning is conceived of as a process by which behavioral responses are incorporated or embedded in the dynamic systems of the individual. The arousal of the dynamic system activates at the same time the behavioral pattern embedded in it, and in this way the gap between learning and action or performance can be bridged. As to the influence of cognition on behavior it is emphasized that cognitive content is a kind of “precipitate” or cristalization of earlier behavioral contacts and that its influence on actual behavior is, therefore, no separate problem.},

Recently researchers have begun to look at how fluency impacts judgment through more subtle and indirect routes. Fluency impacts whether information is represented in working memory and what aspects of that information are attended to. Additionally, fluency has an impact in strategy selection; depending on how fluent information is, people engage in qualitatively different cognitive operations. This suggests that the role of fluency is more nuanced than previously believed and that understanding fluency could be of critical importance to understanding cognition more generally. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Twitter as a new form of social media potentially contains useful information that opens new opportunities for content analysis on tweets. This paper examines the predictive power of Twitter regarding the US presidential election of 2012. For this study, we analyzed 32 million tweets regarding the US presidential election by employing a combination of machine learning techniques. We devised an advanced classifier for sentiment analysis in order to increase the accuracy of Twitter content analysis. We carried out our analysis by comparing Twitter results with traditional opinion polls. In addition, we used the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model to extract the underlying topical structure from the selected tweets. Our results show that we can determine the popularity of candidates by running sentiment analysis. We can also uncover candidates popularities in the US states by running the sentiment analysis algorithm on geo-tagged tweets. To the best of our knowledge, no previous work in the field has presented a systematic analysis of a considerable number of tweets employing a combination of analysis techniques by which we conducted this study. Thus, our results aptly suggest that Twitter as a well-known social medium is a valid source in predicting future events such as elections. This implies that understanding public opinions and trends via social media in turn allows us to propose a cost- and time-effective way not only for spreading and sharing information, but also for predicting future events.},

From this viewpoint, self-regulation involves more than metacognitive knowledge and skill, it involves an underlying sense of self-efficacy and personal agency and the motivational and behavioral processes to put these self beliefs into effect. Views of self-regulated learning that do not include this core self-referential system have difficulty explaining human failures to self-regulate, especially when such efforts are known metacognitively to be helpful. To explain students' self-regulation failures as well as their successes in naturalistic settings, educational psychologists need to expand their views of self-regulation beyond metacognntive trait, ability, or stage formulations and begin treating it as a complex interactive process involving social, motivational, and behavioral components. Such a perspective reveals not only the complexity of self-regulation but also the human side of it-the role of our self-doubts, false beliefs, unfortunate self-monitoring, and strategy choice dilemmas.},

abstract = {Purpose: This paper presents a conceptual framework of how software teams can leverage the implicit information of implemented acceptance tests to cater to the needs of decision makers. The research questions on this framework were 1) how business stakeholders can receive project status information in an intuitive way, and 2) how this framework can guarantee the traceability of tests to requirements. Design/methodology/approach The conceptual framework delineates the design of an acceptance test framework in three aspects: a) how the requirements model reflects the evolving states of requirement maturity over a project, b) how the acceptance test model becomes synchronized with the requirements model without a traceability matrix, c) how the acceptance test model communicates business value to the decision makers. Findings In an industrial case study, the presented framework yielded the positive effects of intuitive understanding by business stakeholders, high test coverage of requirements, and distinctly reduced manual QA work by automated testing for browsers and mobile devices. Practical implications The presented framework can help to convince business stakeholders to approve the budget for building a testing framework because it delivers them value as a status reporting tool. Originality/value This paper is the first to describe a step-by-step approach to solving a critical problem that IT departments frequently face. The solution consists in a new way of transforming the perception of a technical framework into a reporting tool for business information by intuitive design. The idea of mapping hierarchically corresponding abstraction layers can be transferred to other engineering domains.},

abstract = {Color preference is an important aspect of visual experience, but little is known about why people in general like some colors more than others. Previous research suggested explanations based on biological adaptations [Hurlbert AC, Ling YL (2007) Curr Biol 17:623-625] and color-emotions [Ou L-C, Luo MR, Woodcock A, Wright A (2004) Color Res Appl 29:381-389]. In this article we articulate an ecological valence theory in which color preferences arise from people's average affective responses to color-associated objects. An empirical test provides strong support for this theory: People like colors strongly associated with objects they like (e.g., blues with clear skies and clean water) and dislike colors strongly associated with objects they dislike (e.g., browns with feces and rotten food). Relative to alternative theories, the ecological valence theory both fits the data better (even with fewer free parameters) and provides a more plausible, comprehensive causal explanation of color preferences.},

In three experiments, we investigated (1) whether the fluency of generation during study may be a cue for JOLs and (2) whether such fluency effects are mediated by an analytic or nonanalytic inference. To accomplish our goals, we used a learner-observer-judge method. While studying paired associates, learners generated some targets at study. For these items, their JOLs were negatively correlated with the time taken to generate targets. Observers watched learners generate targets and then predicted learners' memory performance. Judges also made JOLs but did not watch the learners generate targets. JOLs from all groups were negatively related to learners' latencies to generate targets, with the magnitude of the relationship equivalent for learners and observers and lower for judges. These and other findings are consistent with the conclusions that the fluency of generation at study is a cue for JOLs and that such fluency effects are partly mediated by an analytic inference about how fluency is related to memory.},

The partner's attractiveness and academic performance were systematically varied in four conditions: high attractiveness/high grades, high attractiveness/low grades, low attractiveness/high grades, and low attractiveness/low grades. After reading the vignette, the students rated the partner's popularity. As hypothesized, analyses of variance revealed that attractive partners were significantly more popular than unattractive partners, regardless of whether the partner had high or low grades. Contrary to expectation, attractiveness was not more important to girls than to boys. Integration with past research and suggestions for future research are offered.},

abstract = {Watching or imagining other people experiencing pain activates the central nervous system's pain matrix in the observer. Without emotion regulation skills, repeated exposure to the suffering of others in healthcare professionals may be associated with the adverse consequences of personal distress, burnout and compassion fatigue, which are detrimental to their wellbeing. Here, we recorded event-related potentials (ERP) from physicians and matched controls as they were presented with visual stimuli depicting body parts pricked by a needle (pain) or touched by a Q-tip (no-pain). The results showed early N110 differentiation between pain and no-pain over the frontal area as well as late P3 over the centro-parietal regions were observed in the control participants. In contrast, no such early and late ERP responses were detected in the physicians. Our results indicate that emotion regulation in physicians has very early effects, inhibiting the bottom-up processing of the perception of pain in others. It is suggested that physicians' down-regulation of the pain response dampens their negative arousal in response to the pain of others and thus may have many beneficial consequences including freeing up cognitive resources necessary for being of assistance. {\textcopyright}2010 Elsevier Inc.},

We suggest how current developments in linguistics can be profitably wedded to work in evolutionary biology, anthropology, psychology, and neuroscience. We submit that a distinction should be made between the faculty of language in the broad sense (FLB) and in the narrow sense (FLN). FLB includes a sensory-motor system, a conceptual-intentional system, and the computational mechanisms for recursion, providing the capacity to generate an infinite range of expressions from a finite set of elements. We hypothesize that FLN only includes recursion and is the only uniquely human component of the faculty of language. We further argue that FLN may have evolved for reasons other than language, hence comparative studies might look for evidence of such computations outside of the domain of communication (for example, number, navigation, and social relations).},

abstract = {Recently, methods have been proposed that perform texture synthesis and style transfer by using convolutional neural networks (e.g. Gatys et al. [2015,2016]). These methods are exciting because they can in some cases create results with state-of-the-art quality. However, in this paper, we show these methods also have limitations in texture quality, stability, requisite parameter tuning, and lack of user controls. This paper presents a multiscale synthesis pipeline based on convolutional neural networks that ameliorates these issues. We first give a mathematical explanation of the source of instabilities in many previous approaches. We then improve these instabilities by using histogram losses to synthesize textures that better statistically match the exemplar. We also show how to integrate localized style losses in our multiscale framework. These losses can improve the quality of large features, improve the separation of content and style, and offer artistic controls such as paint by numbers. We demonstrate that our approach offers improved quality, convergence in fewer iterations, and more stability over the optimization.},

Particular attention is paid to studies evaluating stability of subjective well-being and mean-level change in well-being following major life events. Although early research in this area suggested that subjective well-being showed little change over the life span, more recent longitudinal research has addressed some of the limitations of this early research. The cumulative body of empirical evidence suggests that considerable change can occur, particularly when people experience certain major life events. This chapter also highlights some recent innovations in the study of change in subjective well-being over the life span and identifies some of the important remaining questions in this literature. Overall, this review shows that further work evaluating the underlying factors causing change in subjective well-being will be a fruitful avenue of continued research.},

abstract = {A product's value proposition rests on the notion that it brings value to its customers. Typically, such value is created by having novel product functionality, superior technology, or new customer benefits, but value can also be created by adhering to what is fundamentally important to customers in their lives. Focusing on customers' happiness is a value proposition of the latter kind. Yet, implementing such an approach requires that designers and marketers have a common understanding of the product's value proposition, and work together to create authentic value propositions about happiness that will also be compelling in the marketplace. In this article, we draw upon the positive psychology literature and present three propositions of design for happiness that designers and marketers can use to communicate and create value together. Design for happiness means designing business concepts with the aim of building and supporting long-term consumer happiness. The three propositions that we bring forward are: 1) design for fostering social relationships and belongingness, 2) design for meaning in life, and 3) design for making consumers active participants rather than passive observers. These propositions create a shared understanding of what “design for happiness” can contribute to customers, and how it can contribute to profits and sales.},

abstract = {Variable importance (VI) tools describe how much covariates contribute to a prediction model's accuracy. However, important variables for one well-performing model (for example, a linear model f(x) = xT$\beta$ with a fixed coefficient vector $\beta$) may be unimportant for another model. In this paper, we propose model class reliance (MCR) as the range of VI values across all well-performing model in a prespecified class. Thus, MCR gives a more comprehensive description of importance by accounting for the fact that many prediction models, possibly of different parametric forms, may fit the data well. In the process of deriving MCR, we show several informative results for permutation-based VI estimates, based on the VI measures used in Random Forests. Specifically, we derive connections between permutation importance estimates for a single prediction model, U-statistics, conditional variable importance, conditional causal effects, and linear model coefficients. We then give probabilistic bounds for MCR, using a novel, generalizable technique. We apply MCR to a public data set of Broward County criminal records to study the reliance of recidivism prediction models on sex and race. In this application, MCR can be used to help inform VI for unknown, proprietary models.},

As our method does not require density distillation used in the conventional teacher-student framework, the entire model can be easily trained. Furthermore, our model is able to generate high-fidelity speech even with its compact architecture. In particular, the proposed Parallel WaveGAN has only 1.44 M parameters and can generate 24 kHz speech waveform 28.68 times faster than real-time on a single GPU environment. Perceptual listening test results verify that our proposed method achieves 4.16 mean opinion score within a Transformer-based text-to-speech framework, which is comparative to the best distillation-based Parallel WaveNet system.},

The striatum is critical for the incremental learning of values associated with behavioral actions. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) represents

abstract rules andexplicit contingencies to support rapidbehavioral adaptation in the absenceof cumulative experience.Herewe test two

alternativemodels of the interactionbetween these systems, and individual differences thereof, whenhuman subjects are instructedwith

prior information about reward contingencies that may or may not be accurate. Behaviorally, subjects are overly influenced by prior

instructions, at the expense of learning true reinforcement statistics. Computational analysis found that this pattern of data is best

accounted for by a confirmation bias mechanism in which prior beliefs—putatively represented in PFC—influence the learning that

occurs in the striatum such that reinforcement statistics are distorted. We assessed genetic variants affecting prefrontal and striatal

dopaminergic neurotransmission. A polymorphism in the COMT gene (rs4680), associated with prefrontal dopaminergic function, was

predictive of thedegree towhichparticipants persisted in responding in accordancewithprior instructions even as evidence against their

veracity accumulated. Polymorphisms in genes associated with striatal dopamine function (DARPP-32, rs907094, and DRD2, rs6277)

werepredictive of learning frompositive andnegative outcomes.Notably, these samevariantswerepredictive of thedegree towhich such

learning was overly inflated or neglected when outcomes are consistent or inconsistent with prior instructions. These findings indicate

dissociable neurocomputational and genetic mechanisms by which initial biases are strengthened by experience.

The significance of social media has already been proven in provoking transformation of public opinion for developed countries in improving democratic process of elections. On the contrary, developing countries lacking basic necessities of life possess monopolistic electoral system in which candidates are elected based on tribes, family backgrounds, or landlord influences. They extort voters to cast votes against their promises for the provision of basic needs. Similarly voters also poll votes for personal interests being unaware of party manifesto or national interest. These issues can be addressed by social media, resulting as ongoing process of improvement for presently adopted electoral procedures. People of Pakistan utilized social media to garner support and campaign for political parties in General Elections 2013. Political leaders, parties, and people of Pakistan disseminated party's agenda and advocacy of party's ideology on Twitter without much campaigning cost. To study effectiveness of social media inferred from individual's political behavior, large scale analysis, sentiment detection  {\&}  tweet classification was done in order to classify, predict and forecast election results. The experimental results depicts that social media content can be used as an effective indicator for capturing political behaviors of different parties Positive, negative and neutral behavior of the party followers as well as party's campaign impact can be predicted from the analysis. The analytical findings proved to be having considerable correspondence with actual results as published by Election Commission of Pakistan.},

Problematic cell phone use has alarmingly increased in industrialized countries in the past 10 years. For many perpetrators, it can turn into a behavioural addiction, although this is not a recognized medical condition. Although there are many tools for evaluating this use, one of the most widely used tools is the Mobile Phone Problematic Use Scale (MPPUS), which we test on a representative sample of the population in Spain to obtain an estimate of the prevalence of problematic cell phone use in our midst. The age range consists of 16–65 years, with 1,126 surveys conducted. In this population, we verify that the reliability and internal consistency of the MPPUS ({\$}\alpha{\$} = 0.939) are maintained. Additionally, the construct validity, considering the derived factors (Abuse and Dependence, Craving and Loss of Control, and Dependence on the Social Environment) are aligned with other research and with diverse external criteria of addiction. We establish four categories of users (Casual, Regular, At Risk, and Problematic) and obtain a prevalence of 15.4{\%} among At Risk Users and 5.1{\%} among Problematic Users. This finding implies a total of 20.5{\%} of Users with Problems. A binary logistic regression analysis shows that age, gender, level of education, and daily cell phone use predict problematic cell phone use. The results, based on multiple criteria, show that such problematic use shares features of recognized addictions, affecting large segments of the population and not only adolescents.},

We present two computational approaches that transfer the style from one image (for example, a painting) to a whole video sequence. In our first approach, we adapt to videos the original image style transfer technique by Gatys et al. based on energy minimization. We introduce new ways of initialization and new loss functions to generate consistent and stable stylized video sequences even in cases with large motion and strong occlusion. Our second approach formulates video stylization as a learning problem. We propose a deep network architecture and training procedures that allow us to stylize arbitrary-length videos in a consistent and stable way, and nearly in real time. We show that the proposed methods clearly outperform simpler baselines both qualitatively and quantitatively. Finally, we propose a way to adapt these approaches also to 360 degree images and videos as they emerge with recent virtual reality hardware.},

In both studies, participants predicted the percentage of votes for several political parties and recalled these predictions after the election. The observed hindsight effects were stronger than those found in any prior study on political elections (using percentage of votes as the dependent variable). We argue that the length of the retention interval between original judgement and recollection is mainly responsible for this difference. 
In our second study, we investigated possible artifacts in political hindsight biases using a control-group design where half of the participants recalled their predictions shortly before or after the election. Hindsight bias was preserved, reinforcing the results of earlier studies with non-control-group designs. Finally, we discuss the possibility that the hindsight experience (in political judgement and in general) actually consists of three different, partly independent components.},

abstract = {The drift-diffusion model (DDM) implements an optimal decision procedure for stationary, 2-alternative forced-choice tasks. The height of a decision threshold applied to accumulating information on each trial determines a speed-accuracy tradeoff (SAT) for the DDM, thereby accounting for a ubiquitous feature of human performance in speeded response tasks. However, little is known about how participants settle on particular tradeoffs. One possibility is that they select SATs that maximize a subjective rate of reward earned for performance. For the DDM, there exist unique, reward-rate-maximizing values for its threshold and starting point parameters in free-response tasks that reward correct responses (R. Bogacz, E. Brown, J. Moehlis, P. Holmes, {\&} J. D. Cohen, 2006). These optimal values vary as a function of response-stimulus interval, prior stimulus probability, and relative reward magnitude for correct responses. We tested the resulting quantitative predictions regarding response time, accuracy, and response bias under these task manipulations and found that grouped data conformed well to the predictions of an optimally parameterized DDM. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Psychological Association.},

We also propose a simple way to increase the variation in generated images, and achieve a record inception score of 8.80 in unsupervised CIFAR10. Additionally, we describe several implementation details that are important for discouraging unhealthy competition between the generator and discriminator.

The EAR was programmed to record 30-s snippets of ambient sounds approximately every 12 min during participants' waking hours. Students' social environments and use of language in their natural conversations were mapped in terms of base rates and temporal stability. The degree of cross-context consistency and between-speaker synchrony in language use was assessed. Students' social worlds as well as their everyday language were highly consistent across time and context. The study sheds light on a methodological blind spot - the sampling of naturalistic social information from an unobtrusive observer's perspective.},

abstract = {Design is a ubiquitous, collaborative and highly material activity. Because of the embodied nature of the design profession, designers apply certain collaborative practices to enhance creativity in their everyday work. Within the domain of industrial design, we studied two educational design departments over a period of eight months. Using examples from our fieldwork, we develop our results around three broad themes related to collaborative practices that support the creativity of design professionals: 1) externalization, 2) use of physical space, and 3) use of bodies. We believe that these themes of collaborative practices could provide new insights into designing technologies for supporting a varied set of design activities. We describe two conceptual collaborative systems derived from the results of our study.},

abstract = {Markov models have been used extensively in psychology of learning. Applications of hidden Markov models are rare however. This is partially due to the fact that comprehensive statistics for model selection and model assessment are lacking in the psychological literature. We present model selection and model assessment statistics that are particularly useful in applying hidden Markov models in psychology. These statistics are presented and evaluated by simulation studies for a toy example. We compare AIC, BIC and related criteria and introduce a prediction error measure for assessing goodness-of-fit. In a simulation study, two methods of fitting equality constraints are compared. In two illustrative examples with experimental data we apply selection criteria, fit models with constraints and assess goodness-of-fit. First, data from a concept identification task is analyzed. Hidden Markov models provide a flexible approach to analyzing such data when compared to other modeling methods. Second, a novel application of hidden Markov models in implicit learning is presented. Hidden Markov models are used in this context to quantify knowledge that subjects express in an implicit learning task. This method of analyzing implicit learning data provides a comprehensive approach for addressing important theoretical issues in the field.},

abstract = {Extraversion is a personality trait which has been systematically related to positive affect and well-being. One of the mechanisms that may account for these positive outcomes is the ability to regulate the responses to positive, as well as negative, moods. Prior research has found that extraverts' higher positive mood maintenance could explain their higher levels of positive affect. However, research exploring differences between extraverts and introverts in negative mood regulation has yielded mixed results. The aim of the current study was explore the role of different facets of mood regulation displayed by extraverts, ambiverts, and introverts. After been exposed to a sad vs. happy mood induction, participants underwent a mood regulation task. Extraverts and ambiverts exhibited higher positive mood regulation than introverts, but similar mood repair. Thus, this research highlights the importance of positive mood regulation in the psychological functioning of extraverts, and opens new conceptualizations for developing interventions for introverts to improve their positive mood regulation and, hence, overall positive affect and well-being. {\textcopyright}2016: Servicio de Publicaciones de la Universidad de Murcia.},

abstract = {Cool products provide a leap in value and they increase a company's market share. The widespread adoption of iOS and Android devices resulted in a radical change in the role of technology in people's lives. And anecdotally people exclaimed about how "cool" their devices were; "I can't go back" to what I had before and "I can't stop talking about it-it's so cool!" In 2010 InContext Design launched The Cool Project1 to understand the underlying principles which make a product "cool." The research goal was to discover the core drivers of the cool user experience. This consumer research used qualitative research to identify seven core constructs associated with "coolness" that appeared independently of device or software or even technology product. In 2011 SAP became interested in developing a metric to measure "coolness" and in a joint research effort with InContext Design validated the constructs with business users and co-designed a cool metric. The final result is a repeatable process for measuring cool through a quick survey, the results of which provide implications to product teams on how to improve their products to increase "coolness". This case study outlines the process of using qualitative data to design a valid quantitative measure.},

I support this claim with four ideas about cognition: (1) interacting with tools changes the way we think and perceive -- tools, when manipulated, are soon absorbed into the body schema, and this absorption leads to fundamental changes in the way we perceive and conceive of our environments; (2) we think with our bodies not just with our brains; (3) we know more by doing than by seeing -- there are times when physically performing an activity is better than watching someone else perform the activity, even though our motor resonance system fires strongly during other person observation; (4) there are times when we literally think with things. These four ideas have major implications for interaction design, especially the design of tangible, physical, context aware, and telepresence systems.},

abstract = {The feeding of knowing refers to predictions about subsequent memory performance on previously nonrecalled items. The most frequently investigated type of subsequent performance has been recognition. The present research explored predictive accuracy with two new feeling-of-knowing criterion tests (in addition to recognition): relearning and perceptual identification. In two experiments, people attempted to recall the answers to general-information questions such as, "What is the capital of Australia?", then made feeling-of-knowing predictions for all nonrecalled answers, and finally had a criterion test to assess the accuracy of the feeling-of-knowing predictions. Experiment 1 demonstrated that perceptual identification can be employed successfully as a criterion test for the feeling of knowing. This opens a new way for metamemory research via perception. Moreover, the feeling-of-knowing accuracy for predicting perceptual identification was not significantly correlated with the feeling-of-knowing accuracy for predicting recognition, in accord with the idea that these two tests assess memory differently. Experiment 2 demonstrated that relearning performance can also be predicted by feeling-of-knowing judgments. Both experiments showed that there is a positive relationship between the feeling of knowing and the amount of time elapsing before a memory search is terminated during recall. Further analyses showed that this relationship is substantial for nonrecalled items for which the person did not guess an answer (omission errors), but the relationship is null or negative for nonrecalled items that the person guessed incorrectly (commission errors). Several theoretical mechanisms that may underlie the feeling of knowing are proposed.},

abstract = {Objective: We compared mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) with both cognitive psychological education (CPE) and treatment as usual (TAU) in preventing relapse to major depressive disorder (MDD) in people currently in remission following at least 3 previous episodes. Method: A randomized controlled trial in which 274 participants were allocated in the ratio 2:2:1 to MBCT plus TAU, CPE plus TAU, and TAU alone, and data were analyzed for the 255 (93{\%}; MBCT = 99, CPE = 103, TAU = 53) retained to follow-up. MBCT was delivered in accordance with its published manual, modified to address suicidal cognitions; CPE was modeled on MBCT, but without training in meditation. Both treatments were delivered through 8 weekly classes. Results: Allocated treatment had no significant effect on risk of relapse to MDD over 12 months follow-up, hazard ratio for MBCT vs. CPE = 0.88, 95{\%} CI [0.58, 1.35]; for MBCT vs. TAU = 0.69, 95{\%} CI [0.42, 1.12]. However, severity of childhood trauma affected relapse, hazard ratio for increase of 1 standard deviation = 1.26 (95{\%} CI [1.05, 1.50]), and significantly interacted with allocated treatment. Among participants above median severity, the hazard ratio was 0.61, 95{\%} CI [0.34, 1.09], for MBCT vs. CPE, and 0.43, 95{\%} CI [0.22, 0.87], for MBCT vs. TAU. For those below median severity, there were no such differences between treatment groups. Conclusion: MBCT provided significant protection against relapse for participants with increased vulnerability due to history of childhood trauma, but showed no significant advantage in comparison to an active control treatment and usual care over the whole group of patients with recurrent depression.

And, indeed, the term promises change and a fresh look, without being too specific about its definite meaning.

In Study 1, participants reported their extraversion and positive affect every 3 hr for 2 weeks. Each participant was happier when acting extraverted than when acting introverted. Study 2's diary methodology replicated the relationship for weekly variations in positive affect. Study 3's experimental methodology replicated the relationship when extraversion was manipulated within a fixed situation. Thus, the relationship between extraversion and positive affect, previously demonstrated between persons, also characterizes the internal, ongoing psychological functioning of individuals and is likely to be explained by something capable of rapid intraindividual variation. Furthermore, traits and states are at least somewhat isomorphic, and acting extraverted may increase well-being.},

Feedback is also important for group performance
(Barr {\{}{\&}{\}}amp; Conlon, 1994; Nadler, 1979; Robinson {\{}{\&}{\}}amp; Weldon,
1993; Tindale, 1989; Tindale, Kulik, {\{}{\&}{\}}amp; Scott, 1991), although
the supporting research is somewhat sparse and inconsistent

four aspects of feedback in groups processing information: 
(a) a comparison of the use of feedback by groups and individuals,
(b) the impact of feedback from other group members, 
(c) the distinction between process and outcome feedback, and 
(d) the effect of feedback on group member attributions.

Groups seem better able to use feedback than individuals.

Group discussion may work much like feedback
in the studies above, in that group members get more accurate
representations of how others will act, although increased social
identity and intermember commitments also seem important
(Dawes et al., 1988; Kerr {\{}{\&}{\}}amp; Kaufman-Gilliland, 1994). 

Group discussion can also serve as a type of feedback to group members
(Tindale, 1989). Discussion may also allow members to
realize that other members made choices different from their
own (Hastie {\{}{\&}{\}}amp; Pennington, 1991). This type of social feedback
can reduce confidence (Sniezek, 1992). Taken together, these
studies suggest that group discussion inherently provides internal
feedback to group members, regardless of whether other
external feedback is present.
=
Feedback in groups also affects group member attributions.
Individual-level research has consistently shown that people
make self-serving attributions by attributing success to themselves
and failure to the situation (Ross, 1981). Although group
members also show this tendency (see Leary {\{}{\&}{\}}amp; Forsyth, 1987),
they often attribute responsibility for positive group outcomes
to the group rather than to themselves individually (Forsyth {\{}{\&}{\}}amp;
Schlenker, 1977; Tindale et al., 1991). In addition, group members
use group-level feedback in much the same way as individual-
level feedback when making attributions, especially when
individual feedback is unavailable or negative (Tindale et al.,
1991). Thus, group feedback may change the self-attributional
focus from the individual to the group, which is consistent with
the notions of social categorization theory (Turner {\{}{\&}{\}}amp; Oakes,
1989).},

abstract = {This paper demonstrates how designers can enrich user experiences by purposefully involving negative emotions in user-product interaction. This approach is derived from a framework of rich experience, which explains how and under what circumstances negative emotions make a product experience richer and enjoyable. The approach consists of three steps, where the designer decides 1) which negative emotion is most appropriate for the user context; 2) how and when this emotion is best elicited; and 3) which protective frame is most appropriate to use and in what way it is applied to the product concept. Ten experience qualities were developed that offer prefabricated combinations of these steps, which are intended to lower the threshold of using the approach. The steps for these qualities are described, and each is briefly discussed. Lastly, the applicability of the approach in design is demonstrated by showing six examples of how the qualities have been used to generate concrete product concepts. Reflecting on the approach, we conclude that negative emotions are a viable and interesting starting point for creating emotionally rich product experiences.},

Given an input image with a target object and a driving video sequence depicting a moving object, our framework generates a video in which the target object is animated according to the driving sequence. This is achieved through a deep architecture that decouples appearance and motion information. Our framework consists of three main modules: (i) a Keypoint Detector unsupervisely trained to extract object keypoints, (ii) a Dense Motion prediction network for generating dense heatmaps from sparse keypoints, in order to better encode motion information and (iii) a Motion Transfer Network, which uses the motion heatmaps and appearance information extracted from the input image to synthesize the output frames. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on several benchmark datasets, spanning a wide variety of object appearances, and show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art image animation and video generation methods.},

In particular, the rapid increase in information-based exhibitions has been followed by an expansion of the role of exhibition text as well as the emergence of various typographical presentation methods for more effective communication. Therefore, this research was conducted to study the attention and communication characteristics of exhibition visitors, focusing on the presentation method of using an entire architectural surface, such as the floor, wall, or ceiling of an exhibition hall, as the presentation interface. In addition, in-depth interviews were used after comparative experiments with the panel display, the most popular conventional method used in exhibitions. The test results showed a significant positive correlation between visitor attention and communication. Compared with the panel display, the typographical presentation method utilizing the architectural surface as interface (ASI) was found to increase visitor attention by stimulating more of the visitor's interest and by transforming each exhibition element into a visual reference through variations in the position and scale of typography. Most of all, when compared with the panel display, the ASI display was found to be more effective in communicating with casual visitors who are skimming through the exhibition.},

abstract = {According to the challenge-hindrance model, challenge stressors contain both stressful and challenging aspects, hindrance stressors only stressful aspects. Typically, negative outcomes of challenge stressors refer to well-being (strain), positive outcomes to so-called work outcomes (e.g., productivity, intention to quit). As both effects occur simultaneously, the positive outcomes often emerge only when controlling for the negative effects. We suggest that the negative and the positive effects of challenge stressors may refer to well-being. Specifically, we propose challenge to indicate competence, thus fostering organization-based self-esteem (OBSE), which, in turn, should enhance more general indicators of positive well-being. We explored the effect of time pressure (a prototypical challenge stressor) on a general well-being variable (positive attitude towards life; PAL). We postulated challenge stressors to be associated with PAL positively via OBSE and negatively via strain. These processes should (a) result in a non-significant bivariate association, which should (b) become significant once strain is controlled (suppression), but (c) become insignificant again once OBSE is controlled (mediation). Using structural equation modeling, we could confirm our hypotheses in a cross-sectional study. Results confirm the inherently ambivalent nature of time pressure, containing both positive and negative variance. In line with our theoretical position, results suggest that the negative and the positive outcomes may be conceived in terms of different aspects of well-being, in addition to "work outcomes" that do not refer to well-being. This concept of challenge stressors may help to explain why many people do not reduce challenge stressors even when they could: Feeling good about themselves and their lives may, at least temporarily, outweigh the strain. {\textcopyright}2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {This article aims to investigate the Grand Challenges which arise in the current and emerging landscape of rapid technological evolution towards more intelligent interactive technologies, coupled with increased and widened societal needs, as well as individual and collective expectations that HCI, as a discipline, is called upon to address. A perspective oriented to humane and social values is adopted, formulating the challenges in terms of the impact of emerging intelligent interactive technologies on human life both at the individual and societal levels. Seven Grand Challenges are identified and presented in this article: Human-Technology Symbiosis; Human-Environment Interactions; Ethics, Privacy and Security; Well-being, Health and Eudaimonia; Accessibility and Universal Access; Learning and Creativity; and Social Organization and Democracy. Although not exhaustive, they summarize the views and research priorities of an international interdisciplinary group of experts, reflecting different scientific perspectives, methodological approaches and application domains. Each identified Grand Challenge is analyzed in terms of: concept and problem definition; main research issues involved and state of the art; and associated emerging requirements. BACKGROUND This article presents the results of the collective effort of a group of 32 experts involved in the community of the Human Computer Interaction International (HCII) Conference series. The group's collaboration started in early 2018 with the collection of opinions from all group members, each asked to independently list and describe five HCI grand challenges. During a one-day meeting held on the 20th July 2018 in the context of the HCI International 2018 Conference in Las Vegas, USA, the identified topics were debated and challenges were formulated in terms of the impact of emerging intelligent interactive technologies on human life both at the individual and societal levels. Further analysis and consolidation led to a set of seven Grand Challenges presented herein. This activity was organized and supported by the HCII Conference series.},

abstract = {Symmetric patterns are more appealing to human observers than asymmetric ones. Here, we investigate the visual information processing mechanisms underlying this aesthetic preference. All stimuli were derived from phase scrambled versions of forty face or nature images. In addition to the scrambled images, there were four other types of test image: symmetric, in which one part of the image was a reflection of another around an axis; repetitive, in which one part of the image was a copy of the other; anti-symmetric, similar to symmetric but with the contrast of one side reversed; and interleaved patterns, in which half of the symmetric pattern was replaced by a scrambled image. The number of axes ranged from 1 to 16 for all image types. The task of our 20 observers was to give a preference rating to each image on a 6-point Lickert scale. The preference rating increased with the number of axes for all stimulus types. The observers showed a similar preference for symmetric and repetitive patterns and slightly less preference for anti-symmetric patterns. The preference for interleaved patterns was much less than for other types of stimuli. Preference for an image cannot be explained by either the ecological significance of its content or the slope of its amplitude spectrum. Instead, preference can be accounted for by the complexity of the image. {\textcopyright} 2011 by the authors.},

abstract = {Recent evidence suggests that certain features on the human face indicate hormonal levels during growth, and that women judge the attractiveness of potential partners based on the appearance of these features. One entrenched notion is male facial features that are affected by testosterone are used as direct cues in mate preference. Testosterone may be particularly revealing as it is purported to be an honest indicator of male fitness. Increased testosterone may impose an immunocompetence handicap on the bearer and only the best males can carry this handicap. To date, tests of this theory have been indirect, and have relied on digital manipulations that represent unrealistic continuums of masculine and feminine faces. We provide a much more direct test by manipulating digitally male faces to mimic known shape variation, caused by varying levels of testosterone through puberty. We produced a continuum of faces that ranged from low to high levels of testosterone in male faces and asked women to choose the points on the continuum that appeared most attractive and most physically dominant. Our data indicate that high testosterone faces reveal dominance. However, there is no evidence of directional selection for increased (or decreased) testosterone in terms of attractiveness to the opposite sex. We discuss the relevance and applicability of evolutionary interpretations of our data and, contrary to predictions, provide evidence of stabilizing selection acting on testosterone through mate preferences.},

abstract = {In the last decade, Internet usage has grown tremendously on a global scale. The increasing popularity and frequency of Internet use has led to an increasing number of reports highlighting the potential negative consequences of overuse. Over the last decade, research into Internet addiction has proliferated. This paper reviews the existing 68 epidemiological studies of Internet addiction that (i) contain quantitative empirical data, (ii) have been published after 2000, (iii) include an analysis relating to Internet addiction, (iv) include a minimum of 1000 participants, and (v) provide a full-text article published in English using the database Web of Science. Assessment tools and conceptualisations, prevalence, and associated factors in adolescents and adults are scrutinised. The results reveal the following. First, no gold standard of Internet addiction classification exists as 21 different assessment instruments have been identified. They adopt official criteria for substance use disorders or pathological gambling, no or few criteria relevant for an addiction diagnosis, time spent online, or resulting problems. Second, reported prevalence rates differ as a consequence of different assessment tools and cut-offs, ranging from 0.8{\%} in Italy to 26.7{\%} in Hong Kong. Third, Internet addiction is associated with a number of sociodemographic, Internet use, and psychosocial factors, as well as comorbid symptoms and disorder in adolescents and adults. The results indicate that a number of core symptoms (i.e., compulsive use, negative outcomes and salience) appear relevant for diagnosis, which assimilates Internet addiction and other addictive disorders and also differentiates them, implying a conceptualisation as syndrome with similar etiology and components, but different expressions of addictions. Limitations include the exclusion of studies with smaller sample sizes and studies focusing on specific online behaviours. Conclusively, there is a need for nosological precision so that ultimately those in need can be helped by translating the scientific evidence established in the context of Internet addiction into actual clinical practice.},

In this paper, we present an overview of benefits of co-design in service design projects, in order to help the people involved to articulate more precisely and realistically which benefits to aim for. Based on a literature review and a discussion of three service design projects, we identified three types of benefits: for the service design project; for the service's customers or users; and for the organization(s) involved. These benefits are related to improving the creative process, the service, project management, or longer-term effects. We propose that the people involved in co-design first identify the goals of the service design project and then align their co-design activities, and the associated benefits, to these goals. The paper closes with a brief discussion on the need for developing ways to monitor and evaluate whether the intended benefits are indeed realized, and the need to assess and take into account the costs and risks of co-design},

abstract = {Assumptions regarding the importance of empathy are pervasive. Given the impact these assumptions have on research, assessment, and treatment, it is imperative to know whether they are valid. Of particular interest is a basic question: Are deficits in empathy associated with aggressive behavior? Previous attempts to review the relation between empathy and aggression yielded inconsistent results and generally included a small number of studies. To clarify these divergent findings, we comprehensively reviewed the relation of empathy to aggression in adults, including community, student, and criminal samples. A mixed effects meta-analysis of published and unpublished studies involving 106 effect sizes revealed that the relation between empathy and aggression was surprisingly weak (r = -.11). This finding was fairly consistent across specific types of aggression, including verbal aggression (r = -.20), physical aggression (r = -.12), and sexual aggression (r = -.09). Several potentially important moderators were examined, although they had little impact on the total effect size. The results of this study are particularly surprising given that empathy is a core component of many treatments for aggressive offenders and that most psychological disorders of aggression include diagnostic criteria specific to deficient empathic responding. We discuss broad conclusions, consider implications for theory, and address current limitations in the field, such as reliance on a small number of self-report measures of empathy. We highlight the need for diversity in measurement and suggest a new operationalization of empathy that may allow it to synchronize with contemporary thinking regarding its role in aggressive behavior.},

abstract = {The "tip of the tongue" (TOT) phenomenon is a state in which one cannot quite recall a familiar word but can recall words of similar form and meaning. Several hundred such states were precipitated by reading to Ss the definitions of English words of low frequency and asking them to try to recall the words. It was demonstrated that while in the TOT state, and before recall occurred, Ss had knowledge of some of the letters in the missing word, the number of syllables in it, and the location of the primary stress. The nearer S was to successful recall the more accurate the information he possessed. The re- call of parts of words and attributes of Words is termed "generic recall." The interpreta- tion offered for generic recall involves the assumption that users of a language possess the mental equivalent of a dictionary. The features that figure in generic recall may be entered in the dictionary sooner than other features and so, perhaps, are wired into a more elaborate associative network. These more easily retrieved features of low- frequency words may be the features to which we chiefly attend in word-perception. "lnae features favored by attention, especially the beginnings and endings of words, appear to carry more information than the features that are not favored, in particular the middles of words.},

We distinguish between different ways of representing time in terms of the kinds of temporal frameworks they involve. Distinctions are made between frameworks that are perspectival or nonperspectival and those that represent recurrent sequences or particular times. Even primitive temporal understanding integrates both perspectival and nonperspectival components. However, since early frameworks are event-based and localized, they are not yet sufficient for episodic memory in that they do not enable the child to think of events as having occurred at particular points in time. We describe the emergence of new kinds of frameworks in terms of the development of temporal decentering. Two levels of temporal decentering are distinguished, with the higher level involving an appreciation of how event representations depend on one's temporal perspective. (C) 1999 Academic Press.},

abstract = {Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) has been said to be the most frequently used multivariate analysis technique in statistics. Jennrich and Sampson (1966) solved a significant EFA factor loading matrix rotation problem by deriving the direct Quartimin rotation. Jennrich was also the first to develop standard errors for rotated solutions although these have still not made their way into most statistical software programs. This is perhaps because Jennrichs achievements were partly overshadowed by the subsequent development of confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) by Joreskog (1969). The strict requirement of zero cross-loadings in CFA, however, often does not fit the data well and has led to a tendency to rely on extensive model modification+K55+K119 to find a well-fitting model. In such cases, searching for a well-fitting measurement model may be better carried out by EFA (Browne, 2001). Furthermore, misspecification of zero loadings tends to give distorted factors with over-estimated factor correlations and subsequent distorted structural relations. This paper describes an EFA-SEM (ESEM) approach, where in addition to or instead of a CFA measurement model, an EFA measurement model with rotations can be used in a structural equation model. The ESEM approach has recently been implemented in the Mplus program. ESEM gives access to all the usual SEM parameter and the loading rotation gives a transformation of structural coefficients as well. Standard errors and overall tests of model fit are obtained. Geomin and Target rotations are discussed. Examples of ESEM models include multiple-group EFA with measurement and structural invariance testing, test-retest (longitudinal) EFA, EFA with covariates and direct effects, and EFA with correlated residuals. Testing strategies with sequences of EFA and CFA models are discussed. Simulated data are used to illustrate the points.},

Most measures of communication openness have been criticized as simplistic and imprecise. This paper describes the development of a Communication Openness Measure (COM) based on a well-defined construct, with excellent reliability and adequate validity.

A series of studies were conducted to develop a communication openness measure (COM) based on the concept of openness as specific message sending and receiving behaviors. 
A model of communication behaviors was first developed, consisting of three parts--
who communicates to whom, how, and about what? 
Based on the model, two forms of a 120-item questionnaire were constructed. The first asked whether each of the 120 behaviors was characteristic of open communication, the second asked if they were characteristic of closed behavior. Both forms of the questionnaire were completed by 141 members of the Industrial Communication Council, and by 292 students in a freshman communication course. Analysis resulted in the identification of 48 open communication behaviors and 7 closed behaviors. The subsequent COM contained 55 Likert type items, which field testing then reduced to 19. This 19-item COM was then completed by 495 nurses, and further analysis reduced the instrument to 13 items. The final COM was shown to have excellent reliability and adequate validity. 
The process of developing this instrument suggested the following conclusions: 
(1) communication openness is a central variable in organizational communication; 
(2) open communication behaviors involve asking for information, listening to information, and acting on information; 
(3) given the nature of open communication behaviors, subordinates are generally open to their superiors; 
(4) open communication is a vehicle for handling nonroutine and negative information; and 
(5) open communication is not synonymous with disclosure, and is a receiver-oriented concept rather than a sender-oriented one.},

The course was conducted in two formats: a five-day course and a condensed one-day course. Samples consisted of students and municipality employees (five-day course), and special education teachers (one-day course). Students from a mathematics and statistics course constituted a control group. We measured creative self-efficacy before and after the intervention, and self-efficacy improved significantly for both the five-day and the one-day courses, while the control group showed no changes in creative self-efficacy. Self-efficacy levels increased significantly for both students and municipality employees. A follow-up assessment two months after completing the five-day course showed no decline in creative self-efficacy. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

More specifically it presents a new vision of early design methodologies through immersive technologies. It also presents the results of an experimentation aiming to compare traditional moodboards with a newly developed immersive moodboard. Our results highlight the fact that immersing the industrial designer in a moodboard induces a high emotional activity, without radically modifying the meaning of the represented trend. The spatialisation of the traditional moodboard stimulates and engages the designer to interact with the immersive moodboard. The virtual reality system provides the illusion of a potential reality, which can be used by the designer as a basis for reflection. We believe that delivering this immersive experience during the early design process will help the industrial designer make style related decisions.},

Particularly, we focused on the influence of the valence dimension on the cognitive processing triggered by a non emotional oddball task. To this end, event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded from 25 sites during a visual oddball paradigm. Three sets of pictures (unpleasant, neutral and pleasant) with low arousal values served as rare target items. Subjects were simply asked to realize a standard/target categorization task, irrespective of the picture valence. A temporal principal component analysis allowed us to identify several evoked components (i.e. P1, P2, N2, P3a and P3b). Emotional effects observed on P1, P2 and P3b showed that the valence content of the stimulus modulates the cognitive processes at several points in the information processing stream. {\textcopyright}2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract = {This paper reviews the literature on the problem of information overload, with particular reference to business organisations. The literature reveals that although the problem of information overload has existed for many years, in recent years the problem has become more widely recognised and experienced. Both perceptions and the actual effects of information overload have been exacerbated by the rapid advances made in information and communication technology, although it is not clear cut as to whether the Internet has worsened or improved the situation. A theme stressed in the literature is the paradoxical situation that, although there is an abundance of information available, it is often difficult to obtain useful, relevant information when it is needed. Some solutions put forward to reduce information overload are: a reduction in the duplication of information found in the professional literature; the adoption of personal information management strategies, together with the integration of software solutions such as push technology and intelligent agents; and the provision of value-added information (filtered by software or information specialists). An emphasis is placed on technology as a tool and not the driver, while increased information literacy may provide the key to reducing information overload.},

Some overcame reluctance to promote themselves. Responses were similar from the samples in both countries. An implication for practitioners is that for those who are unaware of the importance of self-promotion, or unwilling to take such actions (and in this study, there were more females than males in this category), this may result in another invisible career barrier.

abstract = {Research on coercion in addiction treatment typically investigates objective sources of social pressure among legally mandated clients. Little research has examined the impact of clients' perceptions of social pressures in generalist addiction services. Clients seeking substance abuse treatment (N = 300; 221 males and 79 females; M age = 36.6 years) rated the extent to which treatment was being sought because of coercive social pressures (external motivation; $\alpha$ = .89), guilt about continued substance abuse (introjected motivation; $\alpha$ = .84), or a personal choice and commitment to the goals of the program (identified motivation; $\alpha$ = .85). External treatment motivation was positively correlated with legal referral, social network pressures to enter treatment, and was inversely related to problem severity. In contrast, identified treatment motivation was positively correlated with self-referral and problem severity, and was inversely related to perceived coercion (ps {\textless} .05). Hierarchical multiple regression analyses showed that referral source (i.e., mandated treatment status), legal history, and social network pressures did not predict any of 6 measures of client engagement at the time treatment was sought. However, treatment motivation variables accounted for unique variance in these outcomes when added to each model ($\Delta$R2s = .06-.23, ps {\textless} .05). Specifically, identified treatment motivation predicted perceived benefits of reducing substance use, attempts to reduce drinking and drug use, as well as self (and therapist) ratings of interest in the upcoming treatment episode ($\beta$s = .18-.31, ps {\textless} .05). Results suggest that the presence of legal referral and/or social network pressures to quit, cut down, and/or enter treatment does not affect client engagement at treatment entry. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Automatically detecting human social intentions and attitudes from spoken conversation is an important task for speech processing and social computing. We describe a system for detecting interpersonal stance: whether a speaker is flirtatious, friendly, awkward, or assertive. We make use of a new spoken corpus of over 1000 4-min speed-dates. Participants rated themselves and their interlocutors for these interpersonal stances, allowing us to build detectors for style both as interpreted by the speaker and as perceived by the hearer. We use lexical, prosodic, and dialog features in an SVM classifier to detect very clear styles (the strongest 10 in each stance) with up to 75 accuracy on previously seen speakers (50 baseline) and up to 59 accuracy on new speakers (48 baseline). A feature analysis suggests that flirtation is marked by joint focus on the woman as a target of the conversation, awkwardness by decreased speaker involvement, and friendliness by a conversational style including other-directed laughter and appreciations. Our work has implications for our understanding of interpersonal stance, their linguistic expression, and their automatic extraction. {\textcopyright}2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In addition to these general trends, however, there are substantial differences among people in what they like and prefer, and in the extent to which their preferences and choices are modulated by design features. Here we aimed to determine whether curvature in real objects and abstract designs influenced participants' preference to the same extent. We found that, in general, participants prefer real objects and abstract designs with curved contours. But we also uncovered a remarkable breadth of variation in individual preferences. Finally, our results show that people who are highly sensitive to curvature in real objects are also highly sensitive to curvature in abstract designs, and that people who are insensitive to curvature in one kind of stimulus are also insensitive to the other.},

abstract = {With our ability to record more neurons simultaneously, making sense of these data is a challenge. Functional connectivity is one popular way to study the relationship between multiple neural signals. Correlation-based methods are a set of currently well-used techniques for functional connectivity estimation. However, due to explaining away and unobserved common inputs (Stevenson et al., 2008), they produce spurious connections. The general linear model (GLM), which models spikes trains as Poisson processes (Okatan et al., 2005; Truccolo et al., 2005; Pillow et al., 2008), avoids these confounds. We develop here a new class of methods by using differential signals based on simulated intracellular voltage recordings. It is equivalent to a regularized AR(2) model. We also expand the method to simulated local field potential (LFP) recordings and calcium imaging. In all of our simulated data, the differential covariance-based methods achieved better or similar performance to the GLM method and required fewer data samples. This new class of methods provides alternative ways to analyze neural signals.},

abstract = {Deep feedforward networks, also often called feedforward neural networks, or multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), are the quintessential deep learning models. The goal of a feedforward network is to approximate some function f * . For example, for a classifier, y = f * (x) maps an input x to a category y. A feedforward network defines a mapping y = f (x; $\theta$) and learns the value of the parameters $\theta$ that result in the best function approximation. These models are called feedforward because information flows through the function being evaluated from x, through the intermediate computations used to define f , and finally to the output y. There are no feedback connections in which outputs of the model are fed back into itself. When feedforward neural networks are extended to include feedback connections, they are called recurrent neural networks, presented in chapter . 10 Feedforward networks are of extreme importance to machine learning practi-tioners. They form the basis of many important commercial applications. For example, the convolutional networks used for object recognition from photos are a specialized kind of feedforward network. Feedforward networks are a conceptual stepping stone on the path to recurrent networks, which power many natural language applications.},

We seek to replicate some of these abilities with a neural network that implements curiosity-driven intrinsic motivation. Using a simple but ecologically naturalistic simulated environment in which the agent can move and interact with objects it sees, the agent learns a world model predicting the dynamic consequences of its actions. Simultaneously, the agent learns to take actions that adversarially challenge the developing world model, pushing the agent to explore novel and informative interactions with its environment. We demonstrate that this policy leads to the self-supervised emergence of a spectrum of complex behaviors, including ego motion prediction, object attention, and object gathering. Moreover, the world model that the agent learns supports improved performance on object dynamics prediction and localization tasks. Our results are a proof-of-principle that computational models of intrinsic motivation might account for key features of developmental visuomotor learning in infants.},

annote = {Note1 VIP goal commitment and social support

Team goal commitment. Commitment to the team goals was assessed using three items from the measure provided by Klein et al. (2001). The items were adapted to reflect team rather than individual goals. The Cronbach coefficient alpha calculated in this study was .85. It should be noted that Klein et al.?s original scale contained five items. However, following a content analysis of the items, we removed two items because they were not consistent enough with the definition of team goal commitment (DeShon {\{}{\&}{\}}amp; Landis, 1997). More specifically, one item aimed to measure perceptions of goal difficulty (?It is hard to take this goal seriously?); the other was rather speculative and did not reflect the actual determination to attain the goal (?It would not take much to make me abandon this goal?). Consequently, three items were retained from Klein et al.?s original scale and were adapted to the team level to form the team goal commitment scale. The items retained were (a) ?We are committed to pursuing the team?s goal?; (b) ?We think it is important to reach the team?s goal?; and (c) ?We really care about achieving the team?s goal.? This last item was reworded as a positive statement to avoid reducing the validity of scale responses or inducing systematic error to the scale (Hinkin, 1995).

@article{Gudem2013,
abstract = {Purpose: The aim of this paper is to suggest a redefinition of the functional product value calculation in lean product development (LPD). The proposed method integrates emotional customer value into the traditional model, which is based on minimizing operating costs and reducing time-to-market. Design/methodology/approach: Perceptions of customer value among employees at a Norwegian boat manufacturer, customers, and competitors are investigated through a case study. Results are compared with principles for promoting value and minimizing waste in LPD. Findings: Findings from the case study suggest that a less-than-perfect match between customer needs and product offerings sometimes improves customer satisfaction. Furthermore, how customers perceive product value depends on experience that may be at variance with current needs. It is also suggested that deep understanding of customer-defined value does not imply an ability to satisfy that value. Research limitations/implications: Understanding the position of meaning-driven and technology-driven innovation in different types of industries represents a challenge for further research, as does the issue of whether these two are the only dimensions driving a sustainable innovation strategy. Actionable knowledge on how emotional value can be maximized is also needed. Originality/value: Maximizing customer value is a core principle in LPD, but the value definitions used tend to be based on logical reasoning rather than real-life observations. This article presents empirical insights concerning different stakeholders' perceptions of customer value, and the resulting implications for the present lean framework. {\textcopyright} Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Three orientations-autonomy, control, and impersonal-are measured by the three subscales of the instrument. Individuals are given a score on each orientation, thus allowing the use of the theoretically appropriate subscale (or, in some cases, a combination of subscales) to predict affects, cognitions, and behaviors.

In our research, we examine how input and time constraints influence the way in which consumers process information during a creative task and how those processes, in turn, influence the creativity of the solution.

abstract = {Traditional approaches to learning have often focused upon knowledge transfer strategies that have centred on textually-based engagements with learners, and dialogic methods of interaction with tutors. The use of virtual worlds, with text-based, voice-based and a feeling of ‘presence' naturally is allowing for more complex social interactions and designed learning experiences and role plays, as well as encouraging learner empowerment through increased interactivity. To unpick these complex social interactions and more interactive designed experiences, this paper considers the use of virtual worlds in relation to structured learning activities for college and lifelong learners. This consideration necessarily has implications upon learning theories adopted and practices taken up, with real implications for tutors and learners alike. Alongside this is the notion of learning as an ongoing set of processes mediated via social interactions and experiential learning circumstances within designed virtual and hybrid spaces. This implies the need for new methodologies for evaluating the efficacy, benefits and challenges of learning in these new ways. Towards this aim, this paper proposes an evaluation methodology for supporting the development of specified learning activities in virtual worlds, based upon inductive methods and augmented by the four-dimensional framework reported in a previous study.{\$}\backslash{\$}r{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}r{\$}\backslash{\$}nThe study undertaken aimed to test the efficacy of the proposed evaluation methodology and framework, and to evaluate the broader uses of a virtual world for supporting lifelong learners specifically in their educational choices and career decisions. The paper presents the findings of the study and considers that virtual worlds are reorganising significantly how we relate to the design and delivery of learning. This is opening up a transition in learning predicated upon the notion of learning design through the lens of ‘immersive learning experiences' rather than sets of knowledge to be transferred between tutor and learner. The challenges that remain for tutors rest with the design and delivery of these activities and experiences. The approach advocated here builds upon an incremental testing and evaluation of virtual world learning experiences.},

In the first study (N = 221), unselected students were photographed and videotaped. In the second study (N = 131), participants were selected on the basis of extremes in PAT, and in the third study (N = 155), participants were preselected for extreme scores on SWB. Correlations between SWB and PAT varied from .03 to .33. In Study 1 the mean correlation between PAT and SWB was .13. When appearance enhancers (hair, clothing, and jewelry) were covered or removed in Studies 2 and 3, the correlation between PAT and SWB dropped, suggesting that part of the SWB–PAT relation might be due to happier people doing more to enhance their beauty. The impact of PAT on SWB may be mitigated by the fact that others agree on a target's PAT at only modest levels. It was found that self-perceptions of PAT were correlated with both one's objective PAT and one's SWB.},

In contrast to most studies that focus on determining only sentiment orientation (positive versus negative), the proposed method performs fine-grained analysis to determine both the sentiment orientation and sentiment strength of the reviewer towards various aspects of a movie. Sentences in review documents contain independent clauses that express different sentiments toward different aspects of a movie. The method adopts a linguistic approach of computing the sentiment of a clause from the prior sentiment scores assigned to individual words, taking into consideration the grammatical dependency structure of the clause. The prior sentiment scores of about 32,000 individual words are derived from SentiWordNet with the help of a subjectivity lexicon. Negation is delicately handled. The output sentiment scores can be used to identify the most positive and negative clauses or sentences with respect to particular movie aspects.},

abstract = {Two scenario studies examined the effects of a person's statement about own abilities and the possibility that the statement could be publicly verified by a subsequent test. Inferences of competence, likeability, and self-presentational motives were assessed. As predicted, a low-ability claim was perceived as more strongly driven by self-presentational motives (being modest or creating a defence against failure) when the ability was going to be tested than when it was not; a high-ability claim was perceived as more strongly driven by self-presentation (impressing others and bragging) when the claim could not be verified. These inferences of motives appeared to mediate trait inferences (judgments of the actor's true competence). In addition, cognitive load affected likeability ratings, but not trait inferences, suggesting that traits were inferred with greater efficiency and that likeability ratings were derived indirectly from inferences of traits and motives. The results illustrate the interplay between trait inferences and lay theories of self-presentational behavior, as well as the relationships between inferences of motives, traits, and likeability.},

@article{Fisher2006,
abstract = {Rarely has one research area gained as much attention as that which is observed for female physical attractiveness. The past decade has resulted in numerous, exciting developments, particularly with respect to three proposed determinants of beauty: waist to hip ratio (WHR), body mass index (BMI), and curvaceousness. The goal of our paper is to provide a highly necessary review of contemporary research on the female attractiveness, including an in-depth examination of these factors. In our review, we first discuss WHR, an index of fat deposition, which is calculated by measuring the circumference of the waist compared to the circumference of the hips. WHR is controlled by the sex hormones, and increases as women age, and hence, may influence perceptions of attractiveness. This factor has been hotly contested, as some researchers have claimed that a WHR of approximately 0.7 is universally most attractive, whereas others have found inconsistent findings, or suggest the importance of other factors, such as BMI. Body mass index (BMI), calculated by dividing the body weight (in kilograms) by height (in meters) squared, serves as a measure of body fat. Although WHR and BMI are correlated, they lead to different conclusions, and the importance of BMI as a measure of female attractiveness is debated in the literature. Similar to WHR research, BMI and its role in attractiveness is not cross-culturally consistent and is affected by the availability of resources within a given environment. It may be the case that both WHR and BMI influence female attractiveness. However, there has been little investigation of this possibility. We have explored this issue in our research, which revealed that both influence attractiveness, but in addition, we noticed that curvaceousness was also a factor. Curvaceousness is the degree of "hourglass" shape as determined, for example, by the size of the bust, relative to the circumference of the hips and waist, and the size of the buttocks. However, curvaceousness does not appear to be temporally stable as a marker of attractiveness, and it is not consistent across modes of presentation. For example, models in male-oriented magazines are more curvaceous than models in female-oriented magazines. In summary, faced with these recent findings, it is difficult to ascertain agreement among the various factors, especially when researchers investigate each determinant in isolation. We conclude that, although researchers have made many important initial steps in examining female attractiveness, there remains much to be discovered.},

Whereas positive mood compared to neutral mood generally facilitates creative performance, mood effects are weaker and less consistent when positive mood is compared to negative mood. These inconsistent results may be due to focusing only on mood valence, while neglecting or confounding mood activation. The current study is based on the dual-pathway model, which describes separate roles for mood valence and mood activation in facilitating creativity. We used experience sampling methodology to investigate the concurrent and lagged effects of mood valence and activation on creative process engagement (CPE) within-person over time among individuals working on a long-term project requiring creativity. We also investigated the moderating effects of individual differences in goal orientation and supervisory support on within-person mood-creativity relationships. As expected, we found that activating positive and activating negative moods were positively associated with concurrent CPE, whereas deactivating moods of both valences were negatively related to CPE. Activating negative mood had a significant lagged effect on CPE, whereas activating positive mood did not. We also found that activating positive mood was more strongly related to concurrent CPE among individuals with high rather than low learning goal orientation. Further, activating positive mood interacted with prove goal orientation and supervisory support for creativity, such that activating positive mood had the strongest association with CPE when both prove goal orientation and supervisory support were high.},

However, very few studies have actually focused on understanding and describing what artists actually do during the creation of an artwork. Therefore, in this study grounded theory was used to investigate this phenomenon and to develop a descriptive model of the art-making process. In Study 1, 16 professional visual artists were interviewed over the course of making a work of art, which provided a descriptive database of their working processes from the inception to the completion of the artwork. Grounded theory was used to analyze the data and to develop a dynamic, descriptive model of the art-making process. A second study involving 9 artists was undertaken to determine the validity of this model. The results suggested that the model has adequate content validity and sufficient scope to accommodate the working processes of a r...},

abstract = {Image captioning, which aims to automatically generate a sentence description for an image, has attracted much research attention in cognitive computing. The task is rather challenging, since it requires cognitively combining the techniques from both computer vision and natural language processing domains. Existing CNN-RNN framework-based methods suffer from two main problems: in the training phase, all the words of captions are treated equally without considering the importance of different words; in the caption generation phase, the semantic objects or scenes might be misrecognized. In our paper, we propose a method based on the encoder-decoder framework, named Reference based Long Short Term Memory (R-LSTM), aiming to lead the model to generate a more descriptive sentence for the given image by introducing reference information. Specifically, we assign different weights to the words according to the correlation between words and images during the training phase. We additionally maximize the consensus score between the captions generated by the captioning model and the reference information from the neighboring images of the target image, which can reduce the misrecognition problem. We have conducted extensive experiments and comparisons on the benchmark datasets MS COCO and Flickr30k. The results show that the proposed approach can outperform the state-of-the-art approaches on all metrics, especially achieving a 10.37{\%} improvement in terms of CIDEr on MS COCO. By analyzing the quality of the generated captions, we come to a conclusion that through the introduction of reference information, our model can learn the key information of images and generate more trivial and relevant words for images.},

Procrastination in one course of study was found to be moderately correlated with procrastination in another, but not to procrastination in the routine tasks of daily living. Evidence for the validity of self-report procrastination scales was the moderate correlation with instructors' ratings. Procrastination was weakly related to emotional upset about it and moderately related to the endorsement of reasons for it-students high in procrastination and emotional upset gave higher reason endorsements (i.e., cited suggested reasons as more reflective of the causes of their procrastination) than the others. Reasons that were judged a priori as less threatening to one's self-esteem received higher endorsements than threatening ones. Contrary to prediction, reasons considered nonthreatening to one's self-esteem were as strongly related to emotional upset and to procrastination as threatening reasons. That students vary in emotional upset about procrastination and in the reasons they give for it highlights the need for comprehensive assessment of students in planning and implementing treatment programs. ?? 1993.},

In particular, we redesign the generator normalization, revisit progressive growing, and regularize the generator to encourage good conditioning in the mapping from latent codes to images. In addition to improving image quality, this path length regularizer yields the additional benefit that the generator becomes significantly easier to invert. This makes it possible to reliably attribute a generated image to a particular network. We furthermore visualize how well the generator utilizes its output resolution, and identify a capacity problem, motivating us to train larger models for additional quality improvements. Overall, our improved model redefines the state of the art in unconditional image modeling, both in terms of existing distribution quality metrics as well as perceived image quality.},

@article{Dietrich2004,
abstract = {Recent theoretical and empirical work in cognitive science and neuroscience is brought into contact with the concept of the flow experience. After a brief exposition of brain function, the explicit-implicit distinction is applied to the effortless information processing that is so characteristic of the flow state. The explicit system is associated with the higher cognitive functions of the frontal lobe and medial temporal lobe structures and has evolved to increase cognitive flexibility. In contrast, the implicit system is associated with the skill-based knowledge supported primarily by the basal ganglia and has the advantage of being more efficient. From the analysis of this flexibility/efficiency trade-off emerges a thesis that identifies the flow state as a period during which a highly practiced skill that is represented in the implicit system's knowledge base is implemented without interference from the explicit system. It is proposed that a necessary prerequisite to the experience of flow is a state of transient hypofrontality that enables the temporary suppression of the analytical and meta-conscious capacities of the explicit system. Examining sensory-motor integration skills that seem to typify flow such as athletic performance, writing, and free-jazz improvisation, the new framework clarifies how this concept relates to creativity and opens new avenues of research. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc.

@article{Cui2018a,
abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Neural style transfer, which has attracted great attention in both academic research and industrial engineering and demonstrated very exciting and remarkable results, is the technique of migrating the semantic content of one image to different artistic styles by using convolutional neural network (CNN). Recently, the Gram matrices used in the original and follow-up studies for style transfer were theoretically shown to be equivalent to minimizing a specific Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). Since the Gram matrices are not a must for style transfer, how to design the proper process for aligning the neural activation between images to perform style transfer is an important problem. After careful analysis of some different algorithms for style loss construction, we discovered that some algorithms consider the relationships between different feature maps of a layer obtained from the CNN (inter-class relationships), while some do not (intra-class relationships). Surprisingly, the latter often show more details and finer strokes in the results. To further support our standpoint, we propose two new methods to perform style transfer: one takes inter-class relationships into account and the other does not, and conduct comparative experiments with existing methods. The experimental results verified our observation. Our proposed methods can achieve comparable perceptual quality yet with a lower complexity. We believe that our interpretation provides an effective design basis for designing style loss function for style transfer methods with different visual effects.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {People are often motivated to increase others' positive experiences and to alleviate others' suffering. These tendencies to care about and help one another form the foundation of human society. When the target is an outgroup member, however, people may have powerful motivations not to care about or help that ‘‘other.'' In such cases, empathic responses are rare and fragile; it is easy to disrupt the chain from perception of suffering to motivation to alleviate the suffering to actual helping.Wehighlight recent interdisciplinary research demonstrating that outgroup members' suffering elicits dampened empathic responses as compared to ingroup members' suffering. We consider an alternative to empathy in the context of intergroup competition: schadenfreude— pleasure at others' pain. Finally, we review recent investigations of intergroup-conflict interventions that attempt to increase empathy for outgroups. We propose that researchers across the range of psychological sciences stand to gain a better under- standing of the foundations of empathy by studying its limitations.},

During the 2012 federal election cycle, we collected Twitter conversations about 10 controversial political topics and mapped their network ties. Using network analysis, we discovered clusters—subgroups of highly self-connected users—and coded messages in each cluster for their expressed positive-to-negative emotional valence, level of support or opposition, and political leaning. We found that valence-based homophily successfully explained the selection of user interactions on Twitter, in terms of expressed emotional valence in their tweets or support versus criticism to an issue. It also finds conservative voices to be associated with negatively valenced clusters and vice versa. This study expands the theory of homophily beyond its traditional conceptualization and provides a new understanding of political-issue interactions in a social media context.},

MobileNetV3 is tuned to mobile phone CPUs through a combination of hardware-aware network architecture search (NAS) complemented by the NetAdapt algorithm and then subsequently improved through novel architecture advances. This paper starts the exploration of how automated search algorithms and network design can work together to harness complementary approaches improving the overall state of the art. Through this process we create two new MobileNet models for release: MobileNetV3-Large and MobileNetV3-Small which are targeted for high and low resource use cases. These models are then adapted and applied to the tasks of object detection and semantic segmentation. For the task of semantic segmentation (or any dense pixel prediction), we propose a new efficient segmentation decoder Lite Reduced Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (LR-ASPP). We achieve new state of the art results for mobile classification, detection and segmentation. MobileNetV3-Large is 3.2{\%} more accurate on ImageNet classification while reducing latency by 20{\%} compared to MobileNetV2. MobileNetV3-Small is 6.6{\%} more accurate compared to a MobileNetV2 model with comparable latency. MobileNetV3-Large detection is over 25{\%} faster at roughly the same accuracy as MobileNetV2 on COCO detection. MobileNetV3-Large LR-ASPP is 34{\%} faster than MobileNetV2 R-ASPP at similar accuracy for Cityscapes segmentation.},

abstract = {This open access book presents the first comprehensive overview of general methods in Automated Machine Learning (AutoML), collects descriptions of existing systems based on these methods, and discusses the first series of international challenges of AutoML systems. The recent success of commercial ML applications and the rapid growth of the field has created a high demand for off-the-shelf ML methods that can be used easily and without expert knowledge. However, many of the recent machine learning successes crucially rely on human experts, who manually select appropriate ML architectures (deep learning architectures or more traditional ML workflows) and their hyperparameters. To overcome this problem, the field of AutoML targets a progressive automation of machine learning, based on principles from optimization and machine learning itself. This book serves as a point of entry into this quickly-developing field for researchers and advanced students alike, as well as providing a reference for practitioners aiming to use AutoML in their work.

The resulting coefficients are then directly comparable for untransformed binary predictors.We have implemented the procedure as a function in R. We illustrate the method with two simple analyses that are typical of applied modeling: a linear regression of data from the National Election Study and a multilevel logistic regression of data on the prevalence of rodents in New York City apartments. We recommend our rescaling as a default option—an improvement upon the usual approach of including variables in whatever way they are coded in the data file—so that the magnitudes of coefficients can be directly compared as a matter of routine statistical practice.},

Later chapters focus on general model-agnostic methods for interpreting black box models like feature importance and accumulated local effects and explaining individual predictions with Shapley values and LIME. All interpretation methods are explained in depth and discussed critically. How do they work under the hood? What are their strengths and weaknesses? How can their outputs be interpreted? This book will enable you to select and correctly apply the interpretation method that is most suitable for your machine learning project. The book focuses on machine learning models for tabular data (also called relational or structured data) and less on computer vision and natural language processing tasks.

Menschen untersch{\{}{\{}{\"{a}}{\}}{\}}tzen im R{\{}{\{}{\"{u}}{\}}{\}}ckblick vor allem das Ausma{\{}{\{}{\ss}{\}}{\}} der Unsicherheit, das zum Zeitpunkt ihrer Prognose bestand.

Sie halten die Zukunft f{\{}{\{}{\"{u}}{\}}{\}}r vorhersagbarer, als sie in Wirklichkeit ist. Biais und Weber befassten sich mit dem R{\{}{\{}{\"{u}}{\}}{\}}ckschaufehler bei B{\{}{\{}{\"{o}}{\}}{\}}rsenprognosen. In einem Experiment lie{\{}{\{}{\ss}{\}}{\}}en sie Studenten prognostizieren, wie sich die Preise bestimmter Aktien und Rohstoffe innerhalb von einer Woche entwickeln. Nach sieben Tagen luden die Forscher die Probanden erneut ins Labor, pr{\{}{\{}{\"{a}}{\}}{\}}sentierten die tats{\{}{\{}{\"{a}}{\}}{\}}chliche Entwicklung der vergangenen Woche und baten um eine neue Prognose f{\{}{\{}{\"{u}}{\}}{\}}r die Zukunft. Der einen H{\{}{\{}{\"{a}}{\}}{\}}lfte der Versuchspersonen wurden ihre urspr{\{}{\{}{\"{u}}{\}}{\}}nglichen Sch{\{}{\{}{\"{a}}{\}}{\}}tzungen aus der Vorwoche vorgelesen. Die anderen Probanden wurden dagegen gebeten, sich selbst an ihre Prognosen zu erinnern. Bei den Studenten, die auf das eigene Ged{\{}{\{}{\"{a}}{\}}{\}}chtnis angewiesen waren, offenbarte sich ein deutlicher R{\{}{\{}{\"{u}}{\}}{\}}ckschaufehler: Sie {\{}{\{}{\"{u}}{\}}{\}}bersch{\{}{\{}{\"{a}}{\}}{\}}tzten ihre Prognose-F{\{}{\{}{\"{a}}{\}}{\}}higkeiten deutlich und erinnerten sich f{\{}{\{}{\"{a}}{\}}{\}}lschlicherweise an Prognosen, die n{\{}{\{}{\"{a}}{\}}{\}}her an der wahren Entwicklung waren. Erstaunlich ist, dass dieser Fehler auch Folgen f{\{}{\{}{\"{u}}{\}}{\}}r die n{\{}{\{}{\"{a}}{\}}{\}}chste Prognose hatte, die diese Gruppe abgeben sollte: Auch die stellte sich sp{\{}{\{}{\"{a}}{\}}{\}}ter meist als schlechter heraus als bei der anderen Gruppe. Biais und Weber erkl{\{}{\{}{\"{a}}{\}}{\}}ren diese Beobachtung damit, dass die Probanden aktuelle Informationen – also die tats{\{}{\{}{\"{a}}{\}}{\}}chliche Kursentwicklung der vergangenen Woche – gedanklich in ihre alte, in der Erinnerung verzerrte Sch{\{}{\{}{\"{a}}{\}}{\}}tzung einbauten. Aber wie allgemeing{\{}{\{}{\"{u}}{\}}{\}}ltig sind Ergebnisse, die auf Experimenten mit Studenten basieren?

Auch dieser Frage gingen die beiden Forscher auf den Grund – sie machten {\{}{\{}{\"{a}}{\}}{\}}hnliche Experimente mit Investmentbankern in Frankfurt und London. Biais und Weber stellten fest: Profis l{\{}{\{}{\"{u}}{\}}{\}}gen sich im R{\{}{\{}{\"{u}}{\}}{\}}ckblick ebenfalls unbewusst in die Tasche und {\{}{\{}{\"{u}}{\}}{\}}bersch{\{}{\{}{\"{a}}{\}}{\}}tzen ihre eigenen Prognosef{\{}{\{}{\"{a}}{\}}{\}}higkeiten deutlich – auch wenn es um Themen geht, bei denen sie sich gut auskennen.

Diese Gruppe gab zudem deutlich bessere Prognosen ab. {\{}{\{}{\"{U}}{\}}{\}}ber wie viel Berufserfahrung die Investmentbanker verf{\{}{\{}{\"{u}}{\}}{\}}gten, spielte dabei keine Rolle. Auff{\{}{\{}{\"{a}}{\}}{\}}llig ist, dass es vor allem die besonders gut verdienenden Investmentbanker waren, deren R{\{}{\{}{\"{u}}{\}}{\}}ckschau eher der Wirklichkeit entsprach. Dieser Effekt, vermuten die Forscher, kommt durch die erfolgsabh{\{}{\{}{\"{a}}{\}}{\}}ngige Bezahlung in der Finanzbranche zustande: Wer st{\{}{\{}{\"{a}}{\}}{\}}rker aus seinen eigenen Fehlern lernt, gibt treffsicherere Prognosen ab, macht bessere Arbeit – und geh{\{}{\{}{\"{o}}{\}}{\}}rt dadurch dann zu den Topverdienern. Wer dagegen nicht in der Lage ist, sich korrekt daran zu erinnern, was er vor der Bekanntgabe neuer Gesch{\{}{\{}{\"{a}}{\}}{\}}ftszahlen eines Unternehmens erwartet hat, der neigt dazu, sich seiner Sache zu sicher zu sein – und trifft h{\{}{\{}{\"{a}}{\}}{\}}ufiger Fehlentscheidungen.

abstract = {Business leaders, governments, and scholars are increasingly recognizing the importance of creativity. Recent trends in technology and education, however, suggest that many individuals are facing fewer opportunities to engage in creative thought as they increasingly solve well-defined (versus ill-defined) problems. Using three studies that involve real problem-solving activities (e.g., putting together a Lego kit), the authors examine the mindset created by addressing such well-defined problems. The studies demonstrate the negative downstream impact of such a mindset on both creative task performance and the choice to engage in creative tasks. The research has theoretical implications for the creativity and mindset literatures as well as substantive insights for managers and public-policy makers.},

abstract = {This article investigated individual control of spacing strategies during study. Three predictions were outlined: The spacing hypothesis suggests that people choose to space their study to improve long-term learning via the spacing effect. The massing hypothesis suggests that people choose to mass their study because of illusions of confidence during study. The metacognitive hypothesis suggests that people control their spacing schedules as a function of their metacognitive judgments of specific to-be-learned items. To test these hypotheses, the authors asked participants to study and make judgments of learning for cue-target pairs. Then, participants were given three choices; they could study the pair again immediately (massed), study the pair again after the entire list had been presented (spaced), or choose not to restudy (done). Results supported a metacognitively controlled spacing strategy-people spaced items that were judged to be relatively easy but massed items that were judged as relatively difficult.},

We build upon recent work leveraging conditional instance normalization for multi-style transfer networks by learning to predict the conditional instance normalization parameters directly from a style image. The model is successfully trained on a corpus of roughly 80,000 paintings and is able to generalize to paintings previously unobserved. We demonstrate that the learned embedding space is smooth and contains a rich structure and organizes semantic information associated with paintings in an entirely unsupervised manner.},

abstract = {We discuss the differences between incremental and radical innovation and argue that each results from different processes. We present several methods of viewing incremental and radical innovation. One is by examining the quality of product space, envisioning each product opportunity as a hill in that space where the higher one is, the better. Under this view, human-centered design methods are a form of hill climbing, extremely well suited for continuous incremental improvements but incapable of radical innovation. Radical innovation requires finding a different hill, and this comes about only through meaning or technology change. A second approach is to consider the dimensions of meaning and technology change as two dimensions and examining how products move through the resulting space. Finally, we show how innovation might be viewed as lying in the space formed by the dimension of research aimed at enhancing general knowledge and the dimension of application to practice.{\$}\backslash{\$}nWe conclude that human-centered design, with its emphasis on iterated observation, ideation, and testing is ideally suited for incremental innovation and unlikely to lead to radical innovation. Radical innovation comes from changes in either technology or meaning. Technology-driven innovation often comes from inventors and tinkerers. Meaning-driven innovation, however, has the potential to be driven through design research, but only if the research addresses fundamental questions of new meanings and their interpretation.},

Some social media sites specialize in people's reviews and making recommendations. Some reviews are positive while others negative. Either way, they have a significant impact on users' decisions of whether purchasing the products or services or not. However, fake reviews and fake users can greatly twist the true opinions that are out there. The detection of fake reviews is critical for any progress toward making great usage of the web. In this work, we analyze the statistics of a Yelp Challenge dataset and propose a simple-but-powerful new detection algorithm based on locations of the reviewers and businesses. We also investigate the prediction of the sentiments of the reviews. We compare the accuracy and false alarm rates of several prediction algorithms. While the results are less than optimum, but there are hopes for strong performance with minor revisions.},

This paper reports a field study designed to investigate the use of agile methods alongside UCD in one particular organization.

abstract = {Design Heuristics is an empirically driven design ideation tool intended to support variation and novelty in concept generation. The set of heuristics was extracted from observations of professional and novice designers at work, and by analyses of a large set of award-winning products. Through the observations of designers at work, we realized that the subconscious use of heuristics could manifest as either a modification of an existing concept or as the development of a new idea seemingly from scratch. Acknowledging this, we sought to understand how Design Heuristics are best taught to novice designers. In this study, we conducted separate instructional sessions on Design Heuristic use, teaching them as a concept generation technique and as a concept transformation technique. Our results show that both approaches yielded design improvements, though the variation between concepts tends to be larger when using a generative approach. Also, Design Heuristics in both approaches helped students elaborate their concepts, generate new ideas, and encouraged them to push forward with previous ideas. These findings contribute to our knowledge about how to best teach Design Heuristics in the classroom.},

Much less attention has been given to scores that may be useful for administrative reasons, such as communicating changes in forecast quality to bureaucrats and providing indications of forecast quality to the general public. The two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) test is proposed as a scoring procedure that is sufficiently generic to be usable on forecasts ranging from simple yes-no forecasts of dichotomous outcomes to forecasts of continuous variables, and can be used with deterministic or probabilistic forecasts without seriously reducing the more complex information when available. Although, as with any single verification score, the proposed test has limitations, it does have broad intuitive appeal in that the expected score of an unskilled set of forecasts (random guessing or perpetually identical forecasts) is 50{\%}, and is interpretable as an indication of how often the forecasts are correct, even when the forecasts are expressed probabilistically and/or the observations are not discrete.},

Subjects were shown representational and abstract paintings in di¡erent formats (original, altered, ¢ltered), and instructed to rate them on aesthetic preference. Our primary results demonstrated that activation in right caudate nucleus decreased in response to de- creasing preference, and that activation in bilateral occipital gyrileft cingulate sulcus, and bilateral fusiform gyri increased in re- sponse to increasing preference.We conclude that the di¡erential patterns of activation observed in the aforementioned structures in response to aesthetic preference are speci¢c examples of their roles in evaluating reward-based stimuli that vary in emotional valence.},

abstract = {Affective computing is an emerging interdisciplinary research field bringing together researchers and practitioners from various fields, ranging from artificial intelligence, natural language processing, to cognitive and social sciences. With the proliferation of videos posted online (e.g., on YouTube, Facebook, Twitter) for product reviews, movie reviews, political views, and more, affective computing research has increasingly evolved from conventional unimodal analysis to more complex forms of multimodal analysis. This is the primary motivation behind our first of its kind, comprehensive literature review of the diverse field of affective computing. Furthermore, existing literature surveys lack a detailed discussion of state of the art in multimodal affect analysis frameworks, which this review aims to address. Multimodality is defined by the presence of more than one modality or channel, e.g., visual, audio, text, gestures, and eye gage. In this paper, we focus mainly on the use of audio, visual and text information for multimodal affect analysis, since around 90{\%} of the relevant literature appears to cover these three modalities. Following an overview of different techniques for unimodal affect analysis, we outline existing methods for fusing information from different modalities. As part of this review, we carry out an extensive study of different categories of state-of-the-art fusion techniques, followed by a critical analysis of potential performance improvements with multimodal analysis compared to unimodal analysis. A comprehensive overview of these two complementary fields aims to form the building blocks for readers, to better understand this challenging and exciting research field.},

abstract = {It is common to use online social content for analyzing political events. Twitter-based data by itself is not necessarily a representative sample of the society due to non-uniform participation. This fact should be noticed when predicting real-world events from social media trends. Moreover, each tweet may bare a positive or negative sentiment towards the subject, which needs to be taken into account. By gathering a large dataset of more than 370,000 tweets on 2016 US Elections and carefully validating the resulting key trends against Google Trends, a legitimate dataset is created. A Gaussian process regression model is used to predict the election outcome; we bring in the novel idea of estimating candidates' vote shares instead of directly anticipating the winner of the election, as practiced in other approaches. Applying this method to the US 2016 Elections resulted in predicting Clinton's majority in the popular vote at the beginning of the elections week with 1{\%} error. The high variance in Trump supporters' behavior reported elsewhere is reflected in the higher error rate of his vote share. {\textcopyright} Copyright 2017 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

annote = {Note1 Introduced Sequential Chi² Difference Tests (SCDT)

Justification for small RMSEA, CFI BUT high SRMR??
In a recent Monte Carlo study, Anderson and Gerbing
(1984) and Gerbing and Anderson (1985) have investigated ML
estimation for a number of sample sizes and a variety of confirmatory
factor models in which the normal theory assumption
was fully met. The results of this study were that although
the bias in parameter estimates is of no practical significance
for sample sizes as low as 50, for a given sample, the deviations
of the parameter estimates from their respective population values
can be quite large. Whereas this does not present a problem
in statistical inference, because the standard errors computed
by the LISREL program are adjusted accordingly, a sample size
of 150 or more typically will be needed to obtain parameter
estimates that have standard errors small enough to be of practical
use.

=========================
p.415 on TD and Lambda for single indicators:
Error estimate for single indicator - TD + LX/LY
this indicator seems unlikely to perfectly
estimate the construct (i.e., has no random measurement error
or measure-specificity component). The question then becomes
{\{}{\&}{\}}quot;At what values should the theta-delta and lambda parameters
be set?{\{}{\&}{\}}quot; To answer this, ideally, a researcher would like to have
an independent estimate for the error variance of the single indicator,
perhaps drawn from prior research, but often this is not
available.
In the absence of an independent estimate, the choice of values
becomes arbitrary. In the past, a conservative value for TD,
such as 0.1 s², has been chosen, and its associated lambda has been set
at .95 sd (e.g., Sorbom {\{}{\&}{\}}amp; Joreskog, 1982). 
Another conservative alternative to consider is to set TD for the single indicator at the
smallest value found for the other, estimated error variances
(06). Although this value is still arbitrary, it has the advantage
of being based on information specific to the given research context.
That is, this indicator shares a respondent sample and survey
instrument with the other indicators.

======================

Convergent validity can be assessed from the measurement
model by determining whether each indicator's estimated pattern
coefficient on its posited underlying construct factor is significant
(greater than twice its standard error).

Discriminant validity 
can be assessed for two estimated constructs by constraining
the estimated correlation parameter (phi{\{}{\_}{\}}ij) between them to 1.0 
and then performing a chi-square difference test
on the values obtained for the constrained and unconstrained
models (Joreskog, 1971). {\{}{\&}{\}}quot;A significantly lower chi² value for the
model in which the trait correlations are not constrained to
unity would indicate that the traits are not perfectly correlated
and that discriminant validity is achieved{\{}{\&}{\}}quot; (Bagozzi {\{}{\&}{\}}amp; Phillips,
1982, p. 476). Although this is a necessary condition for demonstrating
discriminant validity, the practical significance of this
difference will depend on the research setting. This test should
be performed for one pair of factors at a time, rather than as a
simultaneous test of all pairs of interest. 2 The reason for this is
that a nonsignificant value for one pair of factors can be obfuscated
by being tested with several pairs that have significant values.
A complementary assessment of discriminant validity is
to determine whether the confidence interval (+two standard
errors) around the correlation estimate between the two factors
includes 1.0.},

Determining how such systems foster insight and sensemaking is important for their continued growth and study, however. Furthermore, studies that identify how people use such systems and why they benefit (or not) can help inform the design of new systems in this area. We conducted an evaluation of the visual analytics system Jigsaw employed in a small investigative sensemaking exercise, and compared its use to three other more traditional methods of analysis. Sixteen participants performed a simulated intelligence analysis task under one of the four conditions. Experimental results suggest that Jigsaw assisted participants to analyze the data and identify an embedded threat. We describe different analysis strategies used by study participants and how computational support (or the lack thereof) influenced the strategies. We then illustrate several characteristics of the sensemaking process identified in the study and provide design implications for investigative analysis tools based thereon. We conclude with recommendations on metrics and techniques for evaluating visual analytics systems for investigative analysis.},

abstract = {This study evaluates a possible involvement of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and serotonergic (5-HT) system in psychiatric and electroencephalography (EEG) changes during and after pedaling exercise (PE). The subjects performed PE for 15 min using a cycle ergometer. PE rate was kept at 60 rpm, and the work load (93 ± 5.4. W) was decided for each subject before the experiment based on a Rating of Perceived Exertion of 12-13 for self-selected exercise intensity. Cerebral oxygenation in the PFC was assessed by concentration changes in oxygenated hemoglobin (oxyHb) using 24-channel near-infrared spectroscopy. We found that PE evoked a significant increase in oxyHb levels in the ventral PFC during PE as compared with that in the dorsal PFC. Subjects had a feeling of reduced negative mood accompanied by a tendency of increased vigor-activity after PE, as assessed by the Profile of Mood States (POMS) questionnaire. Because the ventral PFC is associated with mood state, we hypothesized that the observed mood changes may have been induced by the activation of the ventral PFC. As for EEG changes during and after PE, we found a significant increase in the relative powers of high-frequency alpha bands (10-13. Hz) during and after PE. A significant increase in whole blood 5-HT level was obtained after PE. Because cortical attenuation would be caused by the 5-HT-induced inhibition of the basal forebrain, we hypothesized that the observed EEG changes are linked with the increased blood 5-HT level or an augmentation of the 5-HT system in the brainstem. {\textcopyright}2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Humans are inherently evaluative beings whose affective system is predisposed to continuously and efficiently produce spontaneous preferences regarding surrounding stimuli. These preferences guide us through the physical world by indicating which stimuli to approach and which to avoid. Vision is the key sense to provide the necessary input for this superficial evaluative process that focuses on the exterior appeal of stimuli. To allow a better understanding of the link between visual input and evaluative response, the present article aims to identify visual antecedents of immediate aesthetic preferences. In particular, we propose a set of 4 algorithmic measures that automatically extract the low-level visual stimulus properties that are predictive of aesthetic preferences according to processing fluency theory: visual simplicity, visual symmetry, visual contrast, and visual self-similarity. In 3 studies, we demonstrate the impact, the relative importance, and the validity of these 4 visual characteristics for understanding aesthetic preferences. We examine the link between the 4 measures and aesthetic liking using a large pool of digital abstract artworks in Study 1. In Study 2, we experimentally replicate the findings of the first study to confirm their robustness. To generalize the results, Study 3 examines preferences for landscape photographs using secondary data of an online photo community. Furthermore, we built a database of 620 abstract digital artworks that can be used to benchmark future developments in measuring antecedents of visual aesthetics and that can serve as a pool of stimuli for experimental research on aesthetics.},

Three hypotheses were generally supported. First, 2 variants of the go/no-go association task revealed that participants, on average, demonstrate an implicit preference (i.e., a positive spontaneous affective reaction) for physical attractiveness in a romantic partner. Second, these implicit measures were not redundant with a traditional explicit measure: The correlation between these constructs was .00 on average, and the implicit measures revealed no reliable sex differences, unlike the explicit measure. Third, explicit and implicit measures exhibited a double dissociation in predictive validity. Specifically, explicit preferences predicted the extent to which attractiveness was associated with participants' romantic interest in opposite-sex photographs but not their romantic interest in real-life opposite-sex speed-daters or confederates. Implicit preferences showed the opposite pattern. This research extends prior work on implicit processes in romantic relationships and offers the first demonstration that any measure of a preference for a particular characteristic in a romantic partner (an implicit measure of physical attractiveness, in this case) predicts individuals' evaluation of live potential romantic partners.},

abstract = {We introduce a two-alternative forced-choice (2AFC) experimental paradigm to quantify expressed emotions in music using the arousal and valence (AV) dimensions. A wide range of well-known audio features are investigated for predicting the expressed emotions in music using learning curves and essential baselines. We furthermore investigate the scalability issues of using 2AFC in quantifying emotions expressed in music on large-scale music databases. The possibility of dividing the annotation task between multiple individuals, while pooling individuals' comparisons is investigated by looking at the subjective differences of ranking emotion in the AV space. We find this to be problematic due to the large variation in subjects' rankings of excerpts. Finally, solving scalability issues by reducing the number of pairwise comparisons is analyzed. We compare two active learning schemes to selecting comparisons at random by using learning curves. We show that a suitable predictive model of expressed valence in music can be achieved from only 15{\%} of the total number of comparisons when using the Expected Value of Information (EVOI) active learning scheme. For the arousal dimension we require 9{\%} of the total number of comparisons. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag.},

It is argued that only a few mediation hypotheses have been investigated in organizational stress research. In the present study it was hypothesized that irritation mediates the effect of social stressors on depressive symptoms. This hypothesis was tested using four waves of a six-wave longitudinal study based on a representative sample (N=313) of the residents of Dresden, Germany. The advantages of longitudinal designs were comprehensively used including the testing of different time lags, the testing of reversed causation, and modelling of unmeasured third variables that may have spuriously created the pattern of observed relationships. Structural equation modelling provided evidence for the proposed mediation mechanism and suggests that time lags of at least 2 years are required to demonstrate },

Compared to other work stressors such as time pressure, role conflict or role ambiguity, there is little research on social stressors in organizations. Social stressors consist of social animosities, conflicts with co-workers and supervisors, unfair behaviour, and a negative group climate. There is reason to believe that social stressors may have strong effects on strains. Zapf and Frese (1991) have shown that social stressors are relatively strong predictors of depressive symptoms in comparison to various task stressors. In a diary study by Schwartz and Stone (1993), 75{\{}{\%}{\}} of all recorded work-related events that indiviudals assessed as harmful were related to negative social interactions with colleagues, supervisors, and clients. Social or interpersonal stressors were an important predictor of other psychological strain variables in the studies of Heinisch and Jex (1997), Keashly, Hunter, and Harvey (1997), Spector (1987), Spector and Jex (1998), and Zapf, Seifert, Schmutte, Mertini, and Holz (2001). Moreover, research on social support at work repeatedly demonstrated that lack of support has negative consequences, underscoring the importance of personal relationships in organizations in comparison with task-related and organization-related issues (e.g. Abdel-Halim, 1982; Ganster, Fusilier, {\{}{\&}{\}}amp; Mayes, 1986; LaRocco, House, {\{}{\&}{\}}amp; French, 1980). Social stressors and lack of support are not identical. Although social stressors and social support tend to be negatively correlated (e.g. Dormann {\{}{\&}{\}}amp; Zapf, 1999), there are exceptions to the rule. For example, a supervisor who pushes all the time could nevertheless be very supportive in getting the job done.

One can assume that there is a relationship between job stressors and social stressors. If there is time pressure, there may be a supervisor being responsible for it. In particular, one may associate role conflict and role ambiguity with the social system at work. However, most researchers consider them to be related to the task structure and the organization of work focusing on unclear or contradictory task goals. Therefore, these concepts are clearly distinct from social stressors comprising social conflicts, personal animosities or unfair behaviour.},

This review highlights current findings from studies of sex differences in human amygdala response during emotion-related activities, such as formation of emotional memories and sexual behavior, and considers how these findings contribute to the understanding of behavioral differences between men and women.

This study examines factors important to Generation Y in determining their trust judgment toward blogs. Study data include twenty-eight in-person interviews and 344 survey responses from Generation Y who read blogs for lifestyle tips and information. Results indicate that trust toward blogs by a blog reader is built on judgments along three dimensions: content, design and the perception of a blogger. Within each dimension, judgments are based on the evaluation of several specific criteria: Content-related criteria include authenticity, curation, and the frequency of posts; design-related criteria include aesthetics, organization, and image qualities; criteria related to the reader's perception of a blogger include perceived expertise/reputation and motives of the blogger. This study also finds that trust directly affects a blog reader's willingness to return to the blog and to recommend it to others. Specifically, speed of navigation and a perceived similarity between the blog writer and the blog reader have direct effects on a blog reader's willingness to return, while information curation, aesthetics, and reputation have direct influence on the blog readers's willingness to recommend the blog to others.},

While deep neural network approaches have recently demonstrated remarkable results in terms of synthesis quality, they still come at considerable computational costs (minutes of run-time for low-res images). Our paper addresses this efficiency issue. Instead of a numerical deconvolution in previous work, we precompute a feed-forward, strided convolutional network that captures the feature statistics of Markovian patches and is able to directly generate outputs of arbitrary dimensions. Such network can directly decode brown noise to realistic texture, or photos to artistic paintings. With adversarial training, we obtain quality comparable to recent neural texture synthesis methods. As no optimization is required any longer at generation time, our run-time performance (0.25M pixel images at 25Hz) surpasses previous neural texture synthesizers by a significant margin (at least 500 times faster). We apply this idea to texture synthesis, style transfer, and video stylization.},

abstract = {Twitter sentiment analysis is quick and inexpensive way for real-time election monitoring and modern day election predictions. Recent research relies on explicit mining of public sentiment using lexical and syntactic features in tweets. However, underlying implicit word relations and co-occurrences are overlooked. This task of capturing semantic relations and word co-occurrences further becomes challenging in case of short length tweets where words are limited. In this paper, we introduce a novel method: Hybrid Topic Based Sentiment Analysis (HTBSA) with the aim of capturing word relations and co-occurrences in short length tweets for election prediction using tweets. First, we extract latent topics from rich corpus of short texts using Biterm Topic model (BTM), then sentiments for each topic are learnt from pre-existing lexical resources. Finally, sentiment score of each tweet is calculated using sentiment orientation and weight of each topic contained in it. We use more than 300,000 tweets, collected from 1st-20th February, 2017, to predict Uttar Pradesh (U.P) legislative elections. Geo tagging is employed for key words which are not exclusive to the elections. Results show that HTBSA has out performed existing Twitter based election prediction techniques with a decrease of 3.5{\%} in MAE. Our study can be easily and efficiently extended for real time election monitoring and future election predictions.},

In this study, the LPP was measured using dense array electroencephalograph both before and after pleasant, neutral, and unpleasant images to examine the time course of attentional allocation toward emotional stimuli. Results from 17 participants confirmed that the LPP was larger after emotional than neutral images and that this effect persisted for 800 ms after pleasant picture offset and at least 1,000 ms after unpleasant picture offset. The persistence of increased attention after unpleasant compared to pleasant stimuli is consistent with the existence of a negativity bias. Overall, these results indicate that attentional capture of emotion continues well beyond picture presentation and that this can be measured with the LPP.

abstract = {When subjects switch between two tasks, performance is slower after a task switch than after a task repetition. We report five experiments showing that a large part of these "task-shift-costs" cannot be attributed to a control operation, needed to configure the cognitive system for the upcoming task (e.g., Rogers {\&} Monsell, 1995). In all experiments subjects switched between picture-naming and word-reading. We presented different stimuli either in just one of the two tasks, or in both of them. Shift-costs were larger for stimuli presented in both tasks than for those presented in only one task, even after more than 100 intervening trials between prime and probe events. We suggest (as proposed by Allport {\&} Wylie, 2000) that stimuli acquire associations with the tasks in which they occur. When the current task activation is weak, as on a switch of tasks, stimuli can trigger retrieval of the associated, competing task, provoking larger time costs. {\textcopyright}2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

I review the idea that WM capacity (a) is separable from short-term memory, (b) is an important component of general fluid intelligence, and (c) represents a domain-free limitation in ability to control attention. Studies show that individual differences in WM capacity are reflected in performance on antisaccade, Stroop, and dichotic-listening tasks. WM capacity, or executive attention, is most important under conditions in which interference leads to retrieval of response tendencies that conflict with the current task.

abstract = {Gatys et al. recently introduced a neural algorithm that renders a content image in the style of another image, achieving so-called style transfer. However, their framework requires a slow iterative optimization process, which limits its practical application. Fast approximations with feed-forward neural networks have been proposed to speed up neural style transfer. Unfortunately, the speed improvement comes at a cost: the network is usually tied to a fixed set of styles and cannot adapt to arbitrary new styles. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective approach that for the first time enables arbitrary style transfer in real-time. At the heart of our method is a novel adaptive instance normalization (AdaIN) layer that aligns the mean and variance of the content features with those of the style features. Our method achieves speed comparable to the fastest existing approach, without the restriction to a pre-defined set of styles. In addition, our approach allows flexible user controls such as content-style trade-off, style interpolation, color {\&} spatial controls, all using a single feed-forward neural network.},

abstract = {Long and short flow scales are examined from dispositional (n=652 long; n=692 short) and state (n=499 long; n=865 short) perspectives. The long flow scales constitute a 36-item multidimensional assessment of flow and have previously demonstrated good psychometric properties. The short flow scales constitute new abbreviated versions of the long forms, contain 9 items, and provide a brief measure of flow from a dimensional perspective. In the current study, long and short flow scales are assessed across a large and diverse physical activity sample. With few exceptions, these flow measures demonstrated acceptable model fit, reliability, and distributions; associations with key correlates in parallel and hypothesized ways; and invariance in factor loadings. Together, the scales provide options for assessing flow in different contexts and when different goals or constraints are operating. Researchers wanting to capture an aggregate of the multidimensional framework might find the short scales a pragmatic alternative when constraints prohibit use of the full-length versions.},

However, research has shown that people do not perform optimally at idea selection and that ideational output may not contribute much to creative idea selection. The present studies aim to explain this phenomenon. We identified the strong tendency of our participants to select feasible and desirable ideas, at the cost of originality, as the main reason for their poor selection performance. Two manipulations of participants' processing of the available ideas (exclusion instructions and quality ratings) had no effect on selection effectiveness. In contrast, explicitly instructing participants to select creative or original ideas did improve selection effectiveness with regard to idea originality, but at the same time decreased participants' satisfaction and the rated effectiveness of chosen ideas. Results are discussed in relation to an effectiveness-originality trade off.},

Secondly, we tend to not solely contemplate a user's own sentimental attributes however conjointly take social sentimental influence into thought. Then, we tend to contemplate product name, which might be inferred by the sentimental distributions of a user set that replicate customers' comprehensive analysis.

@article{Cashdan1996,
abstract = {What does a woman want? The traditional evolutionist's answer to Freud's famous query is that a woman's extensive investment in each child implies that she can maximize her fitness by restricting her sexual activity to one or at most a few high-quality males. Because acquiring resources for her offspring is of paramount importance, a woman will try to attract wealthy, high-status men who are willing and able to help her. She must be coy and choosy, limiting her attentions to men worthy of her and emphasizing her chastity so as not to threaten the paternity confidence of her mate. The lady has been getting more complicated of late, however. As Sarah Hrdy 1 predicted, we now have evidence that women, like other female pri-mates, are also competitive, randy creatures. Women have been seen com-peting with their rivals using both physical aggression 2,3 and more subtle derogation of competitors. 4 While they are still sometimes coy and chaste, women have also been described recently as sexy and sometimes promis-cuous creatures, manipulating fatherhood by the timing of orgasm 5,6 and using their sexuality to garner resources from men. The real answer to Freud's query, of course, is that a woman wants it all: a man with the resources and inclination to invest, and with genes that make him attractive to other women so that her sons will inherit his success. Her strategies for attaining these somewhat conflicting aims, and her success in doing so, are shaped by her own resources and options and by conflicts of interest with men and other women. I begin this review by considering women's mating preferences unconstrained by resource limita-tion or conflicts of interest. The literature has only recently begun to tackle the more interesting problem of how women get what they want in spite of other women who want the same thing and men whose preferences differ from theirs. Most of this paper is concerned with the trade-offs engendered by these conflicts of interest. A caveat is in order before we explore these issues. The preferences and strategies discussed here are assumed to be evolved psychological tendencies. They are not necessarily conscious strategies, nor are they necessarily de-1 sirable, except within the limited framework of fitness maximization. Here, as elsewhere in evolutionary anthropology, the assumption is that natural selection has favored preferences and behaviors that maximize reproductive success. There is nothing in evolutionary theory to suggest that the route to high fitness is necessarily the route to happiness, or that it forms a useful guide for living.},

abstract = {This book presents a thorough overview of a model of human functioning based on the idea that behavior is goal-directed and regulated by feedback control processes. It describes feedback processes and their application to behavior, considers goals and the idea that goals are organized hierarchically, examines affect as deriving from a different kind of feedback process, and analyzes how success expectancies influence whether people keep trying to attain goals or disengage. Later sections consider a series of emerging themes, including dynamic systems as a model for shifting among goals, catastrophe theory as a model for persistence, and the question of whether behavior is controlled or instead 'emerges'. Three chapters consider the implications of these various ideas for understanding maladaptive behavior, and the closing chapter asks whether goals are a necessity of life. Throughout, theory is presented in the context of diverse issues that link the theory to other literatures.

abstract = {Creativity is a vast construct, seemingly intractable to scientific inquiry-perhaps due to the vague concepts applied to the field of research. One attempt to limit the purview of creative cognition formulates the construct in terms of evolutionary constraints, namely that of blind variation and selective retention (BVSR). Behaviorally, one can limit the "blind variation" component to idea generation tests as manifested by measures of divergent thinking. The "selective retention" component can be represented by measures of convergent thinking, as represented by measures of remote associates. We summarize results from measures of creative cognition, correlated with structural neuroimaging measures including structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS). We also review lesion studies, considered to be the "gold standard" of brain-behavioral studies. What emerges is a picture consistent with theories of disinhibitory brain features subserving creative cognition, as described previously (Martindale, 1981). We provide a perspective, involving aspects of the default mode network (DMN), which might provide a "first approximation" regarding how creative cognition might map on to the human brain.},

abstract = {Eventual memory performance is predicted more accurately when a person's judgment of learning (JOL) is delayed until shortly after studying an item than when made immediately after studying the item. According to the transfer-appropriate-monitoring hypothesis, this delayed-JOL effect arises because of the contextual similarity between the cue for the JOL and the cue for the memory test. In three paired-associate learning experiments, delayed JOLs were cued by the stimulus alone or by the stimulus-response pair, and the eventual test was associative recognition of stimulus-response pairs. Recognition of stimulus-response pairs was predicted more accurately when JOLs had been cued by the stimulus alone than when they had been cued by the stimulus-response pair, even though the latter was more similar than the former to the cue for the recognition test. Implications of these results, especially the lack of support for the class of theories emphasizing transfer-appropriate monitoring, are discussed for theories of the accuracy of JOLs.},

In order to analyze the process through which chefs create a specific culinary work (specific dish), the researchers used a qualitative research method. Seventeen award-winning culinary artists from around the world were interviewed, and it was shown how the interview data fit the general categories of Wallas's 4-phase culinary creativity model—preparing the idea, idea incubation, idea development, and evaluation of the product—which the researchers refined via Finke, Ward, and Smith's 1992 Geneplore model, with its cyclic cognitive subprocesses.

abstract = {In this paper I examine the association between subjective time pressure and depression and consider whether time pressure mediates the relationship between roles and depression, whether social and economic resources moderate the association between time pressure and depression, and whether time pressure explains gender differences in depression. Results of a telephone survey of 790 respondents indicate that time pressure is significantly associated with distress for men and women, and that subjective time pressure accounts for the significantly higher depression of employed women. Time pressure mediates the impact of housework and the volunteer role among women and it partially explains the differential depression of divorced men. Several resources moderate the impact of time pressure on depression: income among both men and women and perceived co-worker social support among men. Results suggest that the subjective experience of time pressure can be thought of as a potentially important mechanism by which lived experience is transformed into depression. However, in spite of the ubiquity of time pressure in the North American context, the depressing consequences of this subjective experience are not distributed equitably, suggesting that the capacity to manage time pressure and avoid depression may be another benefit associated with strategically advantageous social locations.},

Compared to the optimization-based method, our network gives similar qualitative results but is three orders of magnitude faster.

abstract = {For statistical learning, categorical variables in a table are usually considered as discrete entities and encoded separately to feature vectors, e.g., with one-hot encoding. “Dirty” non-curated data give rise to categorical variables with a very high cardinality but redundancy: several categories reflect the same entity. In databases, this issue is typically solved with a deduplication step. We show that a simple approach that exposes the redundancy to the learning algorithm brings significant gains. We study a generalization of one-hot encoding, similarity encoding, that builds feature vectors from similarities across categories. We perform a thorough empirical validation on non-curated tables, a problem seldom studied in machine learning. Results on seven real-world datasets show that similarity encoding brings significant gains in predictive performance in comparison with known encoding methods for categories or strings, notably one-hot encoding and bag of character n-grams. We draw practical recommendations for encoding dirty categories: 3-gram similarity appears to be a good choice to capture morphological resemblance. For very high-cardinalities, dimensionality reduction significantly reduces the computational cost with little loss in performance: random projections or choosing a subset of prototype categories still outperform classic encoding approaches.},

Signal detection theory provides a means of assessing discrimination accuracy independent of such bias, but its application crucially depends on distributional assumptions. The Goodman-Kruskal gamma coefficient, G, has been proposed as an alternative means of measuring accuracy that is free of distributional assumptions. This measure is widely used with tasks that assess metamemory or metacognition performance. The authors demonstrate that the empirically determined value of G systematically deviates from its actual value under realistic conditions. A distribution-specific variant of G, called G-sub(c), is introduced to show why this bias arises. The findings imply that caution is needed when using G as a measure of accuracy, and alternative measures are recommended.},

abstract = {Success is found relatively rare in the world of software projects. One possible reason may be the difference in the perception of the meaning of 'success' in the minds of people who evaluate the project performance. Usually, stakeholders external to the project organization use target cost and time for inferring 'project success' while those internal to project agree that the attainment of scope of development decides the 'project success'. Hence, project success criteria, as believed by different groups of stakeholders, do not match. In this study, we examine the views of one such internal set of stakeholders: Programmer/Developers, Project Managers and Customer Account Managers. We conducted an exploratory survey to determine their view of a successful project. We found surprising uniformity in different constituents of this particular group of stakeholders and all of them overwhelmingly considered meeting the scope of software projects, which comprises the functionality and quality of the project outcome, as the highest determinant of success. We believe that this view of software project success in the eyes of software professionals should be studied further to build a comprehensive project evaluation framework and should be utilized effectively to achieve success in terms of external objectives like customer satisfaction and customer happiness.},

Other variables that influence processing fluency, like visual or semantic priming, similarly increase judgments of aesthetic pleasure. Our proposal provides an integrative framework for the study of aesthetic pleasure and sheds light on the interplay between early prefer- ences versus cultural influences on taste, preferences for both prototypical and ab- stracted forms, and the relation between beauty and truth. In contrast to theories that trace aesthetic pleasure to objective stimulus features per se, we propose that beauty is grounded in the processing experiences of the perceiver, which are in part a func- tion of stimulus properties.

abstract = {Consumer behavior offers a useful window on human nature, through which many distinctively human patterns of cognition and behavior can be observed. Consumer behavior should therefore be of central interest to a broad range of psychologists. These patterns include much of what is commonly understood as free will. Our approach to understanding free will sidesteps metaphysical and theological debates. Belief in free will is pervasive in human social life and contributes to its benefits. Evolution endowed humans with a new form of action control, which is what people understand by free will. Its complexity and flexibility are suited to the distinctively human forms of social life in culture, with its abstract rules, expanded time span, diverse interdependent roles, and other sources of opportunities and constraints. Self-control, planful action, and rational choice are vital forms of free will in this sense. The capacity for self-control and intelligent decision making involves a common, limited resource that uses the body's basic energy supply. When this resource is depleted, self-control fails and decision making is impaired. ?? 2007 Society for Consumer Psychology.},

Appearance matters because some facial qualities are so useful in guiding adaptive behavior that even a trace of those qualities can create an impression. Specifically, the qualities revealed by facial cues that characterize low fitness, babies, emotion, and identity are overgeneralized to people whose facial appearance resembles the unfit (anomalous face overgeneralization), babies (babyface overgeneralization), a particular emotion (emotion face overgeneralization), or a particular identity (familiar face overgeneralization). We review studies that support the overgeneralization hypotheses and recommend research that incorporates additional tenets of the ecological theory from which these hypotheses are derived: the contribution of dynamic and multi-modal stimulus information to face perception; bidirectional relationships between behavior and face perception; perceptual learning mechanisms and social goals that sensitize perceivers to particular information in faces.},

/**** USE in dissertation - introduction - agile methods / analogy with problem solving
conceptualization of problem solving as a search,
where I could do the analogy of the "intermediate states" with "working software after iterations"
****/
Newell, A.Simon
Their fundamental proposal was that problem solving could be conceptualized as a process of searching through a problem space for a path connecting the initial state of knowledge (the solver's understanding of the given information) to the goal state (the desired solution).
[...]
Problem space is the term Newell and Simon (1972) coined to refer to the solver's representation of the task as presented (also see Simon, 1978). Briefly, a problem space consists of a set of knowledge states (the initial state, the goal state, and various possible intermediate states), a set of operators that allow movement from one knowledge state to another, and local information about the path one is taking through the space (e.g., the current knowledge state and how one got there).

/**** USE in dissertation - introduction - agile methods / analogy with problem solving
The representation of the problem (=software product to be built) is modeled with various sw modeling techniques,
such as Use Cases and other UML diagrams.
****/
We stated informally at the outset that a problem representation is a model of the problem constructed by solvers to summarize their understanding of the problem's essential nature. More specifically, a 
representation has four components (Markman, 1999):
(1) a represented world - in this case, the description of the problem to be solved, 
(2) a representing world - the set of elements to be used to depict the objects and relations in the represented world, 
(3) a set of rules that map elements of the represented world to elements of the representing world, and 
(4) a process that uses the information in the representing world - in this case, to solve the problem. 
This last component high-lights the link between representation and solution: Without some process that uses the information in the representation for some purpose, the so-called representation has no symbolic meaning (i.e., it does not serve a representational function).

Catrambone, R.1998 The subgoal learning model: Creating better examples so that students can solve novel problems
Subgoals also have been identified as components of task structure that can be taught to learners (Catrambone, 1998). For example, in a statistics class, the task of computing a statistic for testing a hypothesis concerning central tendency can be divided into three subgoals: calculate the observed value, the hypothesized value, and the appropriate standard error. Subgoals in this sense decompose the problem into conceptually distinct and meaningful parts. Identifying the right subgoals thus implies that one has a good understanding of the structure of the problem, that is, a good representation

abstract = {In recent years, researchers and consultants have advanced a number of customer metrics to explain the connections between customer behavior and growth. But these efforts have generated more smoke than heat. Despite claims to the contrary, the authors argue that the most popular metrics have shown only modest correlations to growth. None of them have shown themselves to be universally effective across all competitive environments. Early customer metrics tried to explain why people buy. To many companies, it came down to marketing. Yet, as the authors explain, the issues that affect customer loyalty are complex and go beyond standard marketing. This gave rise to a new category of metrics aimed at understanding the customer experience. Although managers have learned a lot about the components of service quality (including reliability, responsiveness and empathy), the approach doesn't point managers to specific actions they can take. Beginning in the 1990s, many managers began paying closer attention to customer retention -- in particular, understanding what makes for dissatisfaction and satisfaction. But as the authors note, the linkages among satisfaction, customer behavior and positive financial outcomes have been modest. Today's most popular metric, the Net Promoter Score, focuses on how customer word of mouth -- both negative and positive -- can advance growth. Developed by Bain {\&} Company Inc. consultant Fred Reichheld, it claims the ability to predict future growth from customer replies to one question: "How likely is it that you would recommend this company to a friend or colleague?" The authors found that the linkage between the Net Promoter Score and subsequent customer behavior was modest at best; models based on multiple variables consistently outperformed models based on Net Performer. The authors are skeptical that there can be a single metric that reduces complex, multifaceted constructs to one or two dimensions; if there is, they write, "there's a good chance it will ignore one or more important aspects of the equation."

A recent strand of literature within this field has focused on how physical postures that express power and dominance ( power poses) influence psychological and physiological processes, as well as decision making (e.g., Carney, Cuddy, {\&} Yap, 2010; Cesario {\&} McDonald, 2013; Yap, Wazlawek, Lucas, Cuddy, {\&} Carney, 2013). Carney et al. found that power posing affected levels of hormones such as testosterone and cortisol, financial risk taking, and self-reported feelings of power in a sample of 42 participants (randomly assigned to hold poses suggesting either high or low power). We conducted a conceptual replication study with a similar methodology as that employed by Carney et al. but using a substantially larger sample ( N = 200) and a design in which the experimenter was blind to condition. Our statistical power to detect an effect of the magnitude reported by Carney et al. was more than 95{\%} (see the Supplemental Material available online). In addition to the three outcome measures that Carney et al. used, we also studied two more behavioral tasks (risk taking in the loss domain and willingness to compete).

As such, counterfactual mind-sets were expected to improve performance on tasks involving the consideration of relationships and associations but to impair performance on tasks requiring novel ideas that are uninfluenced by salient associations. The authors conducted several experiments to test this hypothesis. In Experiments 1a and 1b, the authors determined that counterfactual mind-sets increase mental states and preferences for thinking styles consistent with relational thought. Experiment 2 demonstrated a facilitative effect of counterfactual mind-sets on an analytic task involving logical relationships; Experiments 3 and 4 demonstrated that counterfactual mind-sets structure thought and imagination around salient associations and therefore impaired performance on creative generation tasks. In Experiment 5, the authors demonstrated that the detrimental effect of counterfactual mind-sets is limited to creative tasks involving novel idea generation; in a creative association task involving the consideration of relationships between task stimuli, counterfactual mind-sets improved performance.},

abstract = {Purpose -- The purpose of this research is to examine different customer satisfaction and loyalty
metrics and test their relationship to customer retention, recommendation and share of wallet using
micro (customer) level data.
Design/methodology/approach The data for this study come from a two-year longitudinal
Internet panel of over 8,000 US customers of firms in one of three industries (retail banking,
mass-merchant retail, and Internet service providers (ISPs)). Correlation analysis, CHAID, and three
types of regression analyses (best-subsets, ordinal logistic, and latent class ordinal logistic regression)
were used to test the hypotheses.
Findings -- Contrary to Reichheld's assertions, the results indicate that recommend intention alone will
not suffice as a single predictor of customers' future loyalty behavior. Use of a multiple indicator instead
of a single predictor model performs better in predicting customer recommendations and retention.
Research limitations/implications -- The limitation of the paper is that it uses data from only
three industries.
Practical implications -- The presumption of managers when looking at recommend intention as
the primary, even sole gauge of customer loyalty appears to be erroneous. The consequence is
potential misallocations of resources due to myopic focus on customers' recommend intentions.
Originality/value -- This is the first scientific study that examines recommend intentions and its
impact on retention and recommendation on the micro (customer) level.},

The current study is the first to examine the effects of actual and perceived similarity simultaneously during a face-to-face initial romantic encounter. Participants attending a speed-dating event interacted with ∼12 members of the opposite sex for 4 min each. Actual and perceived similarity for each pair were calculated from questionnaire responses assessed before the event and after each date. Data revealed that perceived, but not actual, similarity significantly predicted romantic liking in this speed-dating context. Furthermore, perceived similarity was a far weaker predictor of attraction when assessed using specific traits rather than generally. Over},

As predicted, the leaders were more assertive in managing subordinate-subordinate conflicts. Unexpectedly, they also pressed their own subordinates quite forcefully in the subordinate-outsider disputes. The second study investigated subordinates' interventions in their leaders' disputes. In these conflicts, subordinates adopted a low-key shuttle diplomacy; meeting separately with the parties, listening to their opinions, transmitting these to the other side, and calling for each side's empathy and understanding.},

abstract = {Given a signed network where edges are weighted in real number, and positive weights indicate cohesion between ver-tices and negative weights indicate opposition, we are in-terested in finding k-Oppositive Cohesive Groups (k-OCG). Each k-OCG is a group of k subgraphs such that (1) the edges within each subgraph are dense and cohesive; and (2) the edges crossing different subgraphs are dense and opposi-tive. Finding k-OCGs is challenging since the subgraphs are often small, there are multiple k-OCGs in a large signed net-work, and many existing dense subgraph extraction methods cannot handle edges of two signs. We model k-OCG find-ing task as a quadratic optimization problem. However, the classical Proximal Gradient method is very costly since it has to use the entire adjacency matrix, which is huge on large networks. Thus, we develop FOCG, an algorithm that is two orders of magnitudes faster than the Proximal Gra-dient method. The main idea is to only search in small subgraphs and thus avoids using a major portion of the ad-jacency matrix. Our experimental results on synthetic and real data sets as well as a case study clearly demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.},

abstract = {Design offers a potent way to position and to differentiate products and can play a significant role in their success. In many ways it is the focus on deep understanding of the customer or user—what may be termed user-oriented design (UOD)—that transforms a bundle of technology with the ability to provide functionality into a “product” that people desire to interact with and from which they derive benefits. Even though the importance of this type of design is gaining recognition, several fundamental relationships between user-oriented design contributions and the new product development (NPD) process and outcomes (i.e., product) remain unresearched, although they are assumed. This article examines the fundamental relationships underlying the incorporation of a user orientation into the NPD process. The discussion is organized around UOD's impact in terms of enhancing collaborative new product development (process oriented), improving idea generation (process oriented), producing superior product or service solutions (product oriented), and facilitating product appropriateness and adoption (product oriented). Each of these is developed and presented in the form of a research proposition relating to the impact of user-oriented design on product development. The fundamental relationships articulated concerning UOD's impact on NPD form a conceptual framework for this approach to product design and development. For practitioners, the article suggests how user-oriented design can improve NPD through its more grounded and comprehensive approach, along with the elevated appreciation of design challenges and heightened sense of possibilities for a product being developed. For scholars, the article identifies four important areas for UOD research. In addition to the rich avenues offered for research by each of these, the framework presented provides a foundation for further study as well as the development of new measures and tools for enhancing NPD efforts.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Addiction to smartphone usage is a common worldwide problem among adults, which might negatively affect their wellbeing. This study investigated the prevalence and factors associated with smartphone addiction and depression among a Middle Eastern population.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted in 2017 using a web-based questionnaire distributed via social media. Responses to the Smartphone Addiction Scale - Short version (10-items) were rated on a 6-point Likert scale, and their percentage mean score (PMS) was commuted. Responses to Beck's Depression Inventory (20-items) were summated (range 0-60); their mean score (MS) was commuted and categorized. Higher scores indicated higher levels of addiction and depression. Factors associated with these outcomes were identified using descriptive and regression analyses. Statistical significance was set at P {\textless}0.05.
RESULTS: Complete questionnaires were 935/1120 (83.5{\%}), of which 619 (66.2{\%}) were females and 316 (33.8{\%}) were males. The mean ± standard deviation of their age was 31.7 ± 11 years. Majority of participants obtained university education 766 (81.9{\%}), while 169 (18.1{\%}) had school education. The PMS of addiction was 50.2 ± 20.3, and MS of depression was 13.6 ± 10.0. A significant positive linear relationship was present between smart phone addiction and depression (y = 39.2 + 0.8×; P {\textless}0.001). Significantly higher smartphone addiction scores were associated with younger age users, ({\$}\beta{\$} = - 0.203, adj. P = 0.004). Factors associated with higher depression scores were school educated users ({\$}\beta{\$} = - 2.03, adj. P = 0.01) compared to the university educated group and users with higher smart phone addiction scores ({\$}\beta{\$} =0.194, adj. P {\textless}0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The positive correlation between smartphone addiction and depression is alarming. Reasonable usage of smart phones is advised, especially among younger adults and less educated users who could be at higher risk of depression.},

Behavior may also be chosen to pursue (or avoid) anticipated emotional outcomes. Rapid, automatic affective responses, in contrast to the full-blown conscious emotions, may inform cognition and behavioral choice and thereby help guide current behavior. The automatic affective responses may also remind the person of past emotional outcomes and provide useful guides as to what emotional outcomes may be anticipated in the present. To justify replacing the direct causation model with the feedback model, the authors review a large body of empirical findings.},

However, there have been few suggestions as to what factors mediate the influence of these different sources of information on metamnemonic judgments. In this experiment, I examined the interactions between prediction time pressure and variables that promote either cue familiarity or target retrievability. The data reveal that target retrievability plays a larger role than does cue familiarity in fostering predictions of future recall made under unpressured conditions, but that cue familiarity influences predictions that are speeded. This pattern is interpreted by analogy with recognition memory: Mnemonic evidence based on familiarity is more impervious to the demands of time pressure than are the products of deliberative retrieval. Several explanations for this effect are suggested.},

We further explored whether any ability of observers to make such matches is due to people selecting dogs who resemble them, in which case the resemblance should be greater for predictable purebreds than for nonpurebreds, or is due to convergence, in which case the resemblance should grow with duration of ownership. Forty-five dogs and their owners were photographed separately, and judges were shown one owner, that owner's dog, and one other dog, with the task of picking out the true match. The results were consistent with a selection account: Observers were able to match only purebred dogs with their owners, and there was no relation between the ability to pair a person with his or her pet and the time they had cohabited. The ability to match people and pets did not seem to rely on any simple trait matching (e.g., size or hairiness). The results suggest that when people pick a pet, they seek one that, at some level, resembles them, and when they get a purebred, they get what they want.},

abstract = {Statistical models usually require vector representations of categorical variables, using for instance one-hot encoding. This strategy breaks down when the number of categories grows, as it creates high-dimensional feature vectors. Additionally, for string entries, one-hot encoding does not capture information in their representation.Here, we seek low-dimensional encoding of high-cardinality string categorical variables. Ideally, these should be: scalable to many categories; interpretable to end users; and facilitate statistical analysis. We introduce two encoding approaches for string categories: a Gamma-Poisson matrix factorization on substring counts, and the min-hash encoder, for fast approximation of string similarities. We show that min-hash turns set inclusions into inequality relations that are easier to learn. Both approaches are scalable and streamable. Experiments on real and simulated data show that these methods improve supervised learning with high-cardinality categorical variables. We recommend the following: if scalability is central, the min-hash encoder is the best option as it does not require any data fit; if interpretability is important, the Gamma-Poisson factorization is the best alternative, as it can be interpreted as one-hot encoding on inferred categories with informative feature names. Both models enable autoML on the original string entries as they remove the need for feature engineering or data cleaning.},

abstract = {by Elliot E. Entin , Daniel Serfaty INTRODUCTION A ubiquitous factor that teams have to confront and adapt to is stress induced by uncertainty, ambiguity, and time pressure. Stress reduces an individual's or team's flexibility and causes errors (e.g., the Vincennes incident). Janis and Mann (1977) stated that under stress, particularly high stress, team members may experience such an inordinate amount of cognitive constriction and perseveration that their thought processes are disrupted. Not all teams, however, appear to be equally affected. Serfaty, Entin, and Deckert (1993) found that an increase in the level of stress did not necessarily result in a decrease in the team's outcome performance. For example, increasing target uncertainty did not have a direct effect on the identification error-rate of the team; team members simply increased their information-seeking rate. In other words, team members coped by altering their information-seeking strategy, a characteristic that LaPorte and Consolini (1988) attributed to highly reliable teams. The most striking evidence of team adaptation to stress in the experiment conducted by Serfaty, Entin, and Deckert (1993), however, came from the observation that teams were able to maintain the same level of performance with one-third of the time available to make decisions. We maintain, as did Serfaty, Entin, and Deckert (1993), that the primary adaptation mechanism that allowed these teams and teams in general to maintain and improve their performance under a high level of time pressure was a switch from explicit to implicit coordination, a special mode of coordination (Kleinman {\&} Serfaty, 1989; Orasanu, 1990; Wang, Luh, Serfaty, {\&} Kleinman, 1991). Cannon-Bowers and Salas (1990), Orasanu (1990), and others have effectively argued that implicit coordination involves the use of shared or mutual mental models among team members. It is hypothesized that shared mental models are made up of two principal components: a common or consistent model of the tactical situation among team members and a set of mutual mental models about the other team-member functions. It is the mutual mental models that team members have of one another that allow one team member to preempt the actions and needs of another so that actions can be coordinated and needs met in the absence of explicit communication. In this way implicit coordination reduces communication and coordination overhead. For example,...},

abstract = {A comprehensive evolutionary theory of sex differences will benefit from   an accurate assessment of their magnitude across different psychological   domains. This article shows that mainstream research has severely   underestimated the magnitude of psychological sex differences; the   reason lies in the common practice of measuring multidimensional   differences one dimension at a time, without integrating them into a   proper multivariate effect size (ES). Employing the Mahalanobis distance   D (the multivariate generalization of Cohen's d) results in more   accurate, and predictably larger, estimates of overall sex differences   in multidimensional constructs. Two real-world examples are presented:   (1) In a published dataset on Big Five personality traits, sex   differences on individual scales averaged d = .27, a typical ES   conventionally regarded as "small." However, the overall difference was   D = .84 (disattenuated D = .98), implying considerable statistical   separation between male and female distributions. (2) In a recent   meta-analytic summary of sex differences in aggression, the individual   ESs averaged d = .34. However, the overall difference was estimated at D   = .75 - .80 (disattenuated D = .89-1.01). In many psychological domains,   sex differences may be substantially larger than previously   acknowledged.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sex and disgust are basic, evolutionary relevant functions that are often construed as paradoxical. In general the stimuli involved in sexual encounters are, at least out of context strongly perceived to hold high disgust qualities. Saliva, sweat, semen and body odours are among the strongest disgust elicitors. This results in the intriguing question of how people succeed in having pleasurable sex at all. One possible explanation could be that sexual engagement temporarily reduces the disgust eliciting properties of particular stimuli or that sexual engagement might weaken the hesitation to actually approach these stimuli. METHODOLOGY: Participants were healthy women (n = 90) randomly allocated to one of three groups: the sexual arousal, the non-sexual positive arousal, or the neutral control group. Film clips were used to elicit the relevant mood state. Participants engaged in 16 behavioural tasks, involving sex related (e.g., lubricate the vibrator) and non-sex related (e.g., take a sip of juice with a large insect in the cup) stimuli, to measure the impact of sexual arousal on feelings of disgust and actual avoidance behaviour. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The sexual arousal group rated the sex related stimuli as less disgusting compared to the other groups. A similar tendency was evident for the non-sex disgusting stimuli. For both the sex and non-sex related behavioural tasks the sexual arousal group showed less avoidance behaviour (i.e., they conducted the highest percentage of tasks compared to the other groups). SIGNIFICANCE: This study has investigated how sexual arousal interplays with disgust and disgust eliciting properties in women, and has demonstrated that this relationship goes beyond subjective report by affecting the actual approach to disgusting stimuli. Hence, this could explain how we still manage to engage in pleasurable sexual activity. Moreover, these findings suggest that low sexual arousal might be a key feature in the maintenance of particular sexual dysfunctions.},

Accuracy was greater for term-specific than global judgments, but only when pre-judgment recall was required. Term-specific accuracy was also constrained by accessing incorrect information. We argue that TAM is not a viable explanation of accuracy and discuss how to improve judgment accuracy. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Model agnostic tools such as LIME, SHAP, or Break Down promise instance level interpretability for any complex machine learning model. But how certain are these explanations? Can we rely on additive explanations for non-additive models? In this paper, we examine the behavior of model explainers under the presence of interactions. We define two sources of uncertainty, model level uncertainty, and explanation level uncertainty. We show that adding interactions reduces explanation level uncertainty. We introduce a new method iBreakDown that generates non-additive explanations with local interaction.},

A number of his conclusions have been overturned: youth and modest aspirations no longer are seen as prerequisites of SWB. E. Diener's (1984) review placed greater emphasis on theories that stressed psychological factors. In the current article, the authors review current evidence for Wilson's conclusions and discuss modern theories of SWB that stress dispositional influences, adaptation, goals, and coping strategies. The next steps in the evolution of the field are to comprehend the interaction of psychological factors with life circumstances in producing SWB, to understand the causal pathways leading to happiness, understand the processes underlying adaptation to events, and develop theories that explain why certain variables differentially influence the different components of SWB (life satisfaction, pleasant affect, and unpleasant affect).

abstract = {We consider the problem of determining the structure of clustered data, without prior knowledge of the number of clusters or any other information about their composition. Data are represented by a mixture model in which each component corresponds to a different cluster. Models with varying geometric properties are obtained through Gaussian components with different parametrizations and cross-cluster constraints. Noise and outliers can be modelled by adding a Poisson process component. Partitions are determined by the expectation-maximization ({\{}EM{\}}) algorithm for maximum likelihood, with initial values from agglomerative hierarchical clustering. Models are compared using an approximation to the Bayes factor based on the Bayesian information criterion ({\{}BIC{\}}); unlike significance tests, this allows comparison of more than two models at the same time, and removes the restriction that the models compared be nested. The problems of determining the number of clusters and the clustering method are solved simultaneously by choosing the best model. Moreover, the {\{}EM{\}} result provides a measure of uncertainty about the associated classification of each data point. Examples are given, showing that this approach can give performance that is much better than standard procedures, which often fail to identify groups that are either overlapping or of varying sizes and shapes.},

Quantifying uncertainty is especially critical in real-world settings, which often involve input distributions that are shifted from the training distribution due to a variety of factors including sample bias and non-stationarity. In such settings, well calibrated uncertainty estimates convey information about when a model's output should (or should not) be trusted. Many probabilistic deep learning methods, including Bayesian-and non-Bayesian methods, have been proposed in the literature for quantifying predictive uncertainty, but to our knowledge there has not previously been a rigorous large-scale empirical comparison of these methods under dataset shift. We present a large-scale benchmark of existing state-of-the-art methods on classification problems and investigate the effect of dataset shift on accuracy and calibration. We find that traditional post-hoc calibration does indeed fall short, as do several other previous methods. However, some methods that marginalize over models give surprisingly strong results across a broad spectrum of tasks.},

This study has constructed such instruments for eight agile practices, namely iteration planning, iterative development, continuous integration and testing, stand-up meetings, customer access, customer acceptance tests, retrospectives and co-location. The methodological approach followed the scale construction process elaborated in psychological research. We applied both qualitative methods for item generation, and quantitative methods for the analysis of reliability and factor structure (principal factor analysis) to evaluate critical psychometric dimensions. Results in both qualitative and quantitative analyses indicated high psychometric quality of all newly constructed scales. The resulting measurement instruments are available in questionnaire form and ready to be used in future scientific research for quantitative analyses of social-psychological effects of agile practices. ? 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

Moreover, none of existing research reports consider mutual relationships between EI and TP. Our research investigated relationships between TP, EI and the rate of discounting of delayed awards, understood as one of the forms of gratification delay. We also applied a new method of assessing balanced time perspective—the Deviation from the Balanced Time Perspective (DBTP). 126 university students participated in the study. The results obtained suggest the existence of several important connections between TP and EI and moderate impact of DBTP on the process of discounting. Future studies on temporal orientation could be enriched by utilizing this integrative measure of balanced time perspective (the DBTP coefficient) and by partitioning award delays into stages when analyzing temporal discounting strategies.},

Twenty-one states are chosen, with eleven categorized as swing states, five as Clinton favored and five as Trump favored. We incorporate two metrics in polling voter opinion for election outcomes: tweet volume and positive sentiment. Our data is labeled via a convolutional neural network trained on the sentiment140 dataset. To determine whether Twitter is an indicator of election outcome, we compare our results to the election outcome per state and across the nation. We use two approaches for determining state victories: winner-take-all and shared elector count. Our results show tweet sentiment mirrors the close races in the swing states; however, the differences in distribution of positive sentiment and volume between Clinton and Trump are not significant using our approach. Thus, we conclude neither sentiment nor volume is an accurate predictor of election results using our collection of data and labeling process.},

The finding that participation in goal setting led to somewhat higher goal commitment but
not to higher performance than the goals which were assigned is in agreement with the results
obtained in study 2 by Latham et al. (1988). The commitment effect obtained with participatively set
goals, under the conditions used here is simply not strong enough to make a difference
in performance.

The present results imply that participation in decision making may be especially helpful
on complex tasks since: 
(a) on such tasks, strategies have a powerful effect on performance (Locke and Latham, 1990) and, 
(b) each individual is likely to have one or two good strategy ideas, which when shared with others, 
yield a larger pool of effective strategies for each individual
to use than is the case without information sharing. 
This conclusion supports findings from
a field experiment in Norway (Emery and Thorsrud, 1976) where the operators started to learn
from each other and use their new information to make suggestions for technical improvements.

Agile Fit:
The cognitive benefits of participation will depend, of course, not only on the joint development
and sharing of knowledge but also on the locus of knowledge. If subordinates know relatively
little about a subject and the supervisor knows comparatively everything, participation should
have little benefit on performance. This knowledge contingency is worthy of future study.},

Since the social intentions of the speaker may differ from what is perceived by the hearer, systems that analyze human conversations need to be able to extract both the perceived and the intended social meaning. We investigate this difference between intention and perception by using a spoken corpus of speed-dates in which both the speaker and the listener rated the speaker on flirtatiousness. Our flirtationdetection system uses prosodic, dialogue, and lexical features to detect a speaker's intent to flirt with up to 71.5{\%} accuracy, significantly outperforming the baseline, but also outperforming the human interlocuters. Our system addresses lexical feature sparsity given the small amount of training data by using an autoencoder network to map sparse lexical feature vectors into 30 compressed features. Our analysis shows that humans are very poor perceivers of intended flirtatiousness, instead often projecting their own intended behavior onto their interlocutors. {\textcopyright}2009 ACL and AFNLP.},

Although the websites allows us to read reviews and understand the qualities of a restaurant/product ourselves, it is really hard to get an overall idea of the same without reading all the reviews. This makes it difficult for a potential customer to read all the available reviews and take an informed decision on whether to purchase the product or to choose the restaurant for dining or lunch. This paper proposes the method to generate ratings for features of a restaurant/product from its opinionated reviews, i.e., given a set of reviews about a restaurant/product, we can obtain a set of features and its ratings.

abstract = {High levels of meat consumption are increasingly being criticised for ethical, environmental, and social reasons. Plant-based meat substitutes have been identified as healthy sources of protein that, in comparison to meat, offer a number of social, environmental and health benefits and may play a role in reducing meat consumption. However, there has been a lack of research on the role they can play in the policy agenda and how specific meat substitute attributes can influence consumers to replace partially replace meat in their diets. In this paper, we examine consumers' preferences for attributes of meat and meat substitute products and develop consumer segments based on these preferences. The results of a choice experiment with 247 UK consumers, using food labels and mince (ground meat), illustrate that the type of mince, fat content, country of origin and price are major factors that influence choice. Carbon footprint, method of production and brand play a secondary role in determining consumers' choices of meat/meat substitutes. Latent class analysis is used to identify six consumer segments: price conscious, healthy eaters, taste driven, green, organic and vegetarian consumers which have different socio-demographic characteristics and meat consumption patterns. Future interventions and policies aimed at reducing meat consumption including labelling, provision of more information, financial incentives, educational campaigns and new product development will be more effective if they are holistic and target specific consumer segments, instead of focus on the average consumer.},

abstract = {In this theoretical article, we link literature from different disciplines such as the neurosciences and psychology, dance/movement therapy, dance studies, and philosophy, in order to show that interactional, coordinated movement forms an important base for the development of empathy and prosocial behavior. The presented body of literature suggests that specific elements of joint movement and dance, namely imitation, synchronous movement and motoric cooperation, are suitable for fostering empathic abilities, especially in people with empathy deficits. In the second part of the article, we present a newly conceptualized dance and movement intervention for people with empathy dysfunction, tailored to its first application for people with autism spectrum disorders. Through enhancing and refining kinesthetic empathy skills, we hypothesize within an integrative concept of empathy, that both emotional and cognitive empathic processes such as empathic concern and perspective taking can be fostered. With a first treatment outcome study of the presented intervention that we will conduct in the near future with people on the autistic spectrum, we aim at evaluating the program and contributing to the understanding of dance and movement approaches for people with empathy deficits. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Appropriate evaluation is a key component in visualization research. It is typically based on empirical studies that assess visualization components or complete systems. While such studies often include the user of the visualization, empirical research is not necessarily restricted to user studies but may also address the technical performance of a visualization system such as its computational speed or memory consumption. Any such empirical experiment faces the issue that the underlying visualization is becoming increasingly sophisticated, leading to an increasingly difficult evaluation in complex environments. Therefore, many of the established methods of empirical studies can no longer capture the full complexity of the evaluation. One promising solution is the use of data-rich observations that we can acquire during studies to obtain more reliable interpretations of empirical research. For example, we have been witnessing an increasing availability and use of physiological sensor information from eye tracking, electrodermal activity sensors, electroencephalography, etc. Other examples are various kinds of logs of user activities such as mouse, keyboard, or touch interaction. Such data-rich empirical studies promise to be especially useful for studies in the wild and similar scenarios outside of the controlled laboratory environment. However, with the growing availability of large, complex, time-dependent, heterogeneous, and unstructured observational data, we are facing the new challenge of how we can analyze such data. This challenge can be addressed by establishing the subfield of visualization for visualization (Vis4Vis): visualization as a means of analyzing and communicating data from empirical studies to advance visualization research.},

abstract = {Understanding what makes people happy is a central topic in psychology. Prior work has mostly focused on developing self-reporting assessment tools for individuals and relies on experts to analyze the periodic reported assessments. One of the goals of the analysis is to understand what actions are necessary to encourage modifications in the behaviors of the individuals to improve their overall well-being. In this paper, we outline a complementary approach; on the assumption that the user journals her happy moments as short texts, a system can analyze these texts and propose sustainable suggestions for the user that may lead to an overall improvement in her well-being. We prototype one necessary component of such a system, the Happiness Entailment Recognition (HER) module, which takes as input a short text describing an event, a candidate suggestion, and outputs a determination about whether the suggestion is more likely to be good for this user based on the event described. This component is implemented as a neural network model with two encoders, one for the user input and one for the candidate actionable suggestion, with additional layers to capture psychologically significant features in the happy moment and suggestion.},

Relations between general self-efficacy and social cognitive variables (intention, implementation intentions, outcome expectancies, and self-regulation), behavior-specific self-efficacy, health behaviors, well-being, and coping strategies were examined among 1,933 respondents in 3 countries: Germany (n = 633), Poland (n = 359), and South Korea (n = 941). Participants were between 16 and 86 years old, and some were dealing with stressful situations such as recovery from myocardial events or tumor surgery. Perceived self-efficacy was measured by means of the General Self-Efficacy Scale (R. Schwarzer {\&} M. Jerusalem, 1995). Meta-analysis was used to determine population effect sizes for four sets of variables. Across countries and samples, there is consistent evidence for associations between perceived self-efficacy and the variables under study confirming the validity of the psychometric scale. General self-efficacy appears to be a universal construct that yields meaningful relations with other psychological constructs.},

Two methods are proposed for creativity concept evaluation during early design, namely the Comparative Creativity Assessment (CCA) and the Multi-Point Creativity Assessment (MPCA) methods. A critical survey is provided along with a comparison of prominent creativity assessment methods for personalities, products, and the design process. These comparisons culminate in the motivation for new methodologies in creative product evaluation to address certain shortcomings in current methods. The paper details the creation of the two creativity assessment methods followed by an application of the CCA and MPCA to two case studies drawn from engineering design classes.},

We characterize the types of errors that occur using the word count approach, and find lexical ambiguity to be the most prevalent. We then show that one can reduce error with a simple refinement to such lexica by automatically eliminating highly ambiguous words. The resulting refined lexica improve precision as measured by human judgments of word occurrences in Facebook posts.},

annote = {Note2 reliability
p. 115:
A test is said to be reliable if there is little variance that is specific to certain items (Cortina 1993). Our discrimination and item-total correlation checks should alert us to items whith high variance (where everyone gives different answers regardless of their overall score). An alpha value then gives us a reliablity measure for the scale as a whole.
One example of alpha is split-halr reliability (spearman-brown formula). this value is obtained by splitting the test in half (e.g., odd- and even-numbered items), obtaining an alpha statistic for each half and an overall alpha which represents the correlation coefficiient of the two halves with each other. The most commonly used statistic is Cronbach $\alpha$, which is effectively the average of all posssible combinations of split-half reliability (i.e., splitting the test by every possible combination of tiems). The formula is shown below, where N{\{}{\^{}}{\}}2 refers to the square of the number of items, M(COV) to the mean covariance between items, and SUM(VAR/COV) to the sum of all the elements in the variance-covariance matrix.

$\backslash$frac{\{}{\{}{\}}n{\{}{\^{}}{\}}2 $\backslash$times mean(cov){\{}{\}}{\}}{\{}{\{}{\}}sum(var/cov){\{}{\}}{\}}

...The factor structure is also important: alpha is most useful with single-factor tests, where all the items are measures of the same underlying dimension. Where the test incorporates a number of dimensions, we would expect less internal consistency. If each item is closely related to the other items measuring the same dimension (i.e., is answered in the same way by respondents), there will still be little variance that can be attributed to specific items, and alpha will still be high.
Therefore we ned to consider what the test is measuring, and how many items it containts, before interpreting the alpha value.

However, there has been relatively little formal research on the underlying incentives with which to encourage participants to focus their energies on relevant and novel ideas. Several problems have been identified with traditional ideation methods. For example, participants often free ride on other participants' efforts because rewards are typically based on the group-level output of ideation sessions. This paper examines whether carefully tailored ideation incentives can improve creative output. I begin by studying the influence of incentives on idea generation using a formal model of the ideation process. This model illustrates the effect of rewarding participants for their impact on the group and identifies a parameter that mediates this effect. I then develop a practical, web-based asynchronous "ideation game," which allows the implementation and test of various incentive schemes. Using this system, I run two experiments that demonstrate that incentives do have the capability to improve idea generation, confirm the predictions from the theoretical analysis, and provide additional insight on the mechanisms of ideation.

abstract = {We are quickly passing through the historical moment when people work in front of a single computer, dominated by a small CRT and focused on tasks involving only local information. Networked computers are becoming ubiquitous and are playing increasingly significant roles in our lives and in the basic infrastructures of science, business, and social interaction. For human-computer interaction to advance in the new millennium we need to better understand the emerging dynamic of interaction in which the focus task is no longer confined to the desktop but reaches into a complex networked world of information and computer-mediated interactions. We think the theory of distributed cognition has a special role to play in understanding interactions between people and technologies, for its focus has always been on whole environments: what we really do in them and how we coordinate our activity in them. Distributed cognition provides a radical reorientation of how to think about designing and supporting human-computer interaction. As a theory it is specifically tailored to understanding interactions among people and technologies. In this article we propose distributed cognition as a new foundation for human-computer interaction, sketch an integrated research framework, and use selections from our earlier work to suggest how this framework can provide new opportunities in the design of digital work materials.},

abstract = {This review chapter examines the literature on work team effectiveness. To begin, we consider their nature, define them, and identify four critical conceptual issues—context, workflow, levels, and time—that serve as review themes and discuss the multitude of forms that teams may assume. We then shift attention to the heart of the review, examining key aspects of the creation, development, operation, and management of work teams. To accomplish objectives of breadth and integration, we adopt a life-cycle perspective to organize the review. Topics involved in the team life cycle include: (1) team composition; (2) team formation, socialization, and development; (3) team processes, effectiveness, and enhancements; (4) team leadership and motivation; (5) and team continuance and decline. We characterize representative theory and research, identify thematic limitations, and highlight work that is beginning to push the boundaries on our critical conceptual issues. We also address application concerns where possible. Finally, we close with a discussion that reflects back on the topics, considers the state of progress regarding our critical conceptual themes, and suggests directions for new research to foster continued progress and development.},

abstract = {Research supports the central role cognitive strategies can play in successful concept generation by individual designers. Design heuristics have been shown to facilitate the creation of new design concepts in the early, conceptual stage of the design process, as well as throughout the development of ideas. However, we know relatively little about their use in differing disciplines. This study examined evidence of design heuristic use in a protocol study with 12 mechanical engineers and 12 industrial designers who worked individually to develop multiple concepts. The open-ended design problem was for a novel product, and the designers' sketches and comments were recorded as they worked on the problem for 25 min and in a retrospective interview. The results showed frequent use of design heuristics in both disciplines and a significant relationship to the rated creativity of the concepts. Though industrial designers used more heuristics in their concepts, there was a high degree of similarity in heuristic use. Some differences between design disciplines were observed in the choice of design heuristics, where industrial designers showed a greater emphasis on user experience, environmental contexts, and added features. These findings demonstrate the prevalence of design heuristics in individual concept generation and their effectiveness in generating creative concepts, across two design domains.},

Analyses identified 5 environmental characteristics that independently predicted greater perceived creativity: (a) complexity of visual detail, (b) view of natural environment, (c) use of natural materials, (d) with fewer cool colors used, and (e) less use of manufactured or composite surface materials. In Study 2, tests of actual creative performance were administered in 2 different settings.

abstract = {Several studies on hemodynamic brain activity indicate that emotional visual stimuli elicit greater activation than neutral stimuli in attention-related areas such as the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the visual association cortex (VAC). In order to explore the temporo-spatial characteristics of the interaction between attention and emotion, two processes characterized by involving short and rapid phases, event-related potentials (ERPs) were measured in 29 subjects using a 60-electrode array and the LORETA source localization software. A cue/target paradigm was employed in order to investigate both expectancy-related and input processing-related attention. Four categories of stimuli were presented to subjects: positive arousing, negative arousing, relaxing, and neutral. Three attention-related components were finally analyzed: N280pre (from pretarget ERPs), P200post and P340post (both from posttarget ERPs). N280pre had a prefrontal focus (ACC and/or medial prefrontal cortex) and presented significantly lower amplitudes in response to cues announcing negative targets. This result suggests a greater capacity of nonaversive stimuli to generate expectancy-related attention. P200post and P340post were both elicited in the VAC, and showed their highest amplitudes in response to negative- and to positive-arousing stimuli, respectively. The origin of P200post appears to be located dorsally with respect to the clear ventral-stream origin of P340post. The conjunction of temporal and spatial characteristics of P200post and P340post leads to the deduction that input processing-related attention associated with emotional visual stimulation involves an initial, rapid, and brief "early" attentional response oriented to rapid motor action, being more prominent towards negative stimulation. This is followed by a slower but longer "late" attentional response oriented to deeper processing, elicited to a greater extent by appetitive stimulation.},

We conducted a meta-analysis of 385 functional neuroimaging studies of emotional processing, examining the effects of experimental characteristics on the probability of detecting amygdala activity. All emotional stimuli were associated with higher probability of amygdala activity than neutral stimuli. Comparable effects were observed for most negative and positive emotions, however there was a higher probability of activation for fear and disgust relative to happiness. The level of attentional processing affected amygdala activity, as passive processing was associated with a higher probability of activation than active task instructions. Gustatory-olfactory and visual stimulus modalities increased the probability of activation relative to internal stimuli. Aversive learning increased the probability of amygdala activation as well. There was some evidence of hemispheric specialization with a relative left-lateralization for stimuli containing language and a relative right-lateralization for masked stimuli. Methodological variables, such as type of analysis and magnet strength, were also independent predictors of amygdala activation. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Collaborations between engineers, Human Factors specialists, industrial designers and medical end users were foreseen, but actual methodologies had to be developed. Three applications were used as development vehicles and as demonstrators. The resulting teamwork and process of indentifying requirements, finding solutions (in technology and workflow), and shifting between these to optimize and speed development towards quality of care were studied. The ARIS*ER approach solves current problems in collaborative teams, taking a systems approach, and manages the overview of requirements and solutions, which is too complex to manage centrally. {\textcopyright}2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Companies routinely squander their most precious resource--the time of their top executives. In the typical company, senior executives meet to discuss strategy for only three hours a month. And that time is poorly spent in diffuse discussions never even meant to result in any decision. The price of misused executive time is high. Delayed strategic decisions lead to overlooked waste and high costs, harmful cost reductions, missed new product and business development opportunities, and poor long-term investments. But a few deceptively simple changes in the way top management teams set agendas and structure team meetings can make an enormous difference in their effectiveness. Efficient companies use seven techniques to make the most of the time their top executives spend together. They keep strategy meetings separate from meetings focused on operations. They explore issues through written communications before they meet, so that meeting time is used solely for reaching decisions. In setting agendas, they rank the importance of each item according to its potential to create value for the company. They seek to get issues not only on, but also off, the agenda quickly, keeping to a clear implementation timetable. They make sure they have considered all viable alternatives before deciding a course of action. They use a common language and methodology for reaching decisions. And they insist that, once a decision is made, they stick to it--that there be no more debate or mere grudging compliance. Once leadership teams get the basics right, they can make more fundamental changes in the way they work together. Strategy making can be transformed from a series of fragmented and unproductive events into a streamlined, effective, and continuing management dialogue. In companies that have done this, management meetings aren't a necessary evil; they're a source of real competitive advantage.

@article{Ibarra2017,
abstract = {Previous research has investigated ways to quantify visual information of a scene in terms of a visual processing hierarchy, i.e.,making sense of visual environment by segmentation and integration of elementary sensory input. Guided by this research, studies have developed categories for low-level visual features (e.g., edges, colors), high-level visual features (scene-level entities that convey semantic information such as objects), and how models of those features predict aesthetic preference and naturalness. For example, in Kardan et al. (2015a), 52 participants provided aesthetic preference and naturalness ratings, which are used in the current study, for 307 images of mixed natural and urban content. Kardan et al. (2015a) then developed a model using low-level features to predict aesthetic preference and naturalness and could do so with high accuracy. What has yet to be explored is the ability of higher-level visual features (e.g., horizon line position relative to viewer, geometry of building distribution relative to visual access) to predict aesthetic preference and naturalness of scenes, and whether higher-level featuresmediate some of the association between the low-level features and aesthetic preference or naturalness. In this study we investigated these relationships and found that low- and high- level features explain 68.4{\%} of the variance in aesthetic preference ratings and 88.7{\%} of the variance in naturalness ratings. Additionally, several high-level features mediated the relationship between the low-level visual features and aaesthetic preference. In a multiple mediation analysis, the high-level feature mediators accounted for over 50{\%} of the variance in predicting aesthetic preference. These results show that high-level visual features play a prominent role predicting aesthetic preference, but do not completely eliminate the predictive power of the low-level visual features. These strong predictors provide powerful insights for future research relating to landscape and urban design with the aim of maximizing subjective well-being, which could lead to improved health outcomes on a larger scale.},

abstract = {In fine art, especially painting, humans have mastered the skill to create unique visual experiences through composing a complex interplay between the content and style of an image. Thus far the algorithmic basis of this process is unknown and there exists no artificial system with similar capabilities. However, in other key areas of visual perception such as object and face recognition near-human performance was recently demonstrated by a class of biologically inspired vision models called Deep Neural Networks. Here we introduce an artificial system based on a Deep Neural Network that creates artistic images of high perceptual quality. The system uses neural representations to separate and recombine content and style of arbitrary images, providing a neural algorithm for the creation of artistic images. Moreover, in light of the striking similarities between performance-optimised artificial neural networks and biological vision, our work offers a path forward to an algorithmic understanding of how humans create and perceive artistic imagery.},

Research shows both positive and negative impacts of smartphone and social platform use. Positive outcomes relate to social capital and engagement, while negative impacts result from compulsive usage, negative comparisons and the stress of being ‘always on'. Little evidence is available regarding wellbeing impacts of smartphone use at particular times of day. This study measures the impact of overnight smartphone use on wellbeing. Experimental group participants abstained from smartphone use in the bedroom for one week. The Subjective Happiness Scale, Quality of Life Scale, Smartphone Addiction Scale and Intensity {\&} Time Affect Survey were issued at the beginning and end of the week. Paired sample T-Tests compared pre and post intervention participant surveys scores. It was hypothesised that subjective wellbeing would increase. In three out of four measures (SAS-SV, SHS and QOLS) the hypothesis was upheld, although impacts were relatively small. 93.6{\%} of experimental group participants said they “might' or “would” consider self-imposing intervention conditions moving forward, suggesting that participants experienced greater benefits not measurable through the questionnaires selected. Some qualitative analysis supports exploration of findings. Further research to explore other wellbeing impacts is encouraged.},

abstract = {Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) has been said to be the most frequently used multivariate analysis technique in statistics. Jennrich and Sampson (1966) solved a significant EFA factor loading matrix rotation problem by deriving the direct Quartimin rotation. Jennrich was also the first to develop standard errors for rotated solutions although these have still not made their way into most statistical software programs. This is perhaps because Jennrichs achievements were partly overshadowed by the subsequent development of confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) by Joreskog (1969). The strict requirement of zero cross-loadings in CFA, however, often does not fit the data well and has led to a tendency to rely on extensive model modification+K55+K119 to find a well-fitting model. In such cases, searching for a well-fitting measurement model may be better carried out by EFA (Browne, 2001). Furthermore, misspecification of zero loadings tends to give distorted factors with over-estimated factor correlations and subsequent distorted structural relations. This paper describes an EFA-SEM (ESEM) approach, where in addition to or instead of a CFA measurement model, an EFA measurement model with rotations can be used in a structural equation model. The ESEM approach has recently been implemented in the Mplus program. ESEM gives access to all the usual SEM parameter and the loading rotation gives a transformation of structural coefficients as well. Standard errors and overall tests of model fit are obtained. Geomin and Target rotations are discussed. Examples of ESEM models include multiple-group EFA with measurement and structural invariance testing, test-retest (longitudinal) EFA, EFA with covariates and direct effects, and EFA with correlated residuals. Testing strategies with sequences of EFA and CFA models are discussed. Simulated data are used to illustrate the points.
==
This study is a methodological-substantive synergy, demonstrating the power and flexibility of exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM) methods that integrate confirmatory and exploratory factor analyses (CFA and EFA), as applied to substantively important questions based on multidimentional students' evaluations of university teaching (SETs). For these data, there is a well established ESEM structure but typical CFA models do not fit the data and substantially inflate correlations among the nine SET factors (median rs = .34 for ESEM, .72 for CFA) in a way that undermines discriminant validity and usefulness as diagnostic feedback. A 13-model taxonomy of ESEM measurement invariance is proposed, showing complete invariance (factor loadings, factor correlations, item uniquenesses, item intercepts, latent means) over multiple groups based on the SETs collected in the first and second halves of a 13-year period. Fully latent ESEM growth models that unconfounded measurement error from communality showed almost no linear or quadratic effects over this 13-year period. Latent multiple indicators multiple causes models showed that relations with background variables (workload/difficulty, class size, prior subject interest, expected grades) were small in size and varied systematically for different ESEM SET factors, supporting their discriminant validity and a construct validity interpretation of the relations. A new approach to higher order ESEM was demonstrated, but was not fully appropriate for these data. Based on ESEM methodology, substantively important questions were addressed that could not be appropriately addressed with a traditional CFA approach.},

Aspects of emotionwork, such as automatic emotion regulation, surface acting, and deep acting, are discussed from an action theory point of view. Empirical studies so far show that emotionwork has both positive and negative effects on health. Negative effects were found for emotional dissonance. Concepts related to the frequency of emotion expression and the requirement to be sensitive to the emotions of others had both positive and negative effects. Control and social support moderate relations between emotionwork variables and burnout and job satisfaction. Moreover, there is empirical evidence that the cooccurrence of emotionwork and organizational problems leads to high levels of burnout.},

annote = {Note3 cohesion strongly correlated with social support AND moderately with participation
Strong correlations were found between 
- task cohesion and team spirit (r = .72), 
- social support among team members (r = .68), 
- the extent of cooperative behavior among team members (r = .62),and

- the extent of sharing the workload equally (r = .58). 
Participation in team decision making and the degree to which individual
goals were determined by team goals were moderately related to
task cohesion (r = .48 and r = .33, respectively).

Some would argue that helping each other out (i.e., social support) and cooperating with other team members
are part of the definition of social cohesion (Langfred, 1998; O'Reilly{\{}{\&}{\}}amp;Caldwell, 1985;Wech et al., 1998). 
An alternate view is that communication and cooperation are antecedents of social cohesion (Carron, 1988; Lott {\{}{\&}{\}}amp; Lott, 1965).

Cohesive group members are cooperative, supportive of one another, and have open communication {\{}{\&}{\}}gt; WRONG CITATIONS: (Griffith, 1988; Wech et al., 1998). 
Cooperation may involve sharing the workload to achieve group goals and participating in the decision-making process (Hogg, 1992). 
Cohesive groups are typically described as having strong morale or group spirit (Bollen {\{}{\&}{\}}amp; Hoyle, 1990; Griffith, 1988). 

Campion, Medsker, and Higgs (1993) devised a scale to assess work-group characteristics associated with group effectiveness.
A number of the subscales assess dimensions that are associated
with group cohesion, for example, group spirit/morale, social
support, communication/cooperation within the team, the extent of
workload sharing, and participation in decision making and goal
interdependence. Because the latter dimensions are similar in
meaning to group cohesion, it is expected that they will moderately
correlate with the GEQ; this will be taken as evidence of construct
validity (Anastastasi {\{}{\&}{\}}amp; Urbina, 1997; Cronbach, 1990).},

abstract = {Several lines of evidence support that dopaminergic neurotransmission plays a role in creative thought and behavior. Here, we investigated the relationship between creative ability and dopamine D2 receptor expression in healthy individuals, with a focus on regions where aberrations in dopaminergic function have previously been associated with psychotic symptoms and a genetic liability to schizophrenia. Scores on divergent thinking tests (Inventiveness battery, Berliner Intelligenz Struktur Test) were correlated with regional D2 receptor densities, as measured by Positron Emission Tomography, and the radioligands [(11)C]raclopride and [(11)C]FLB 457. The results show a negative correlation between divergent thinking scores and D2 density in the thalamus, also when controlling for age and general cognitive ability. Hence, the results demonstrate that the D2 receptor system, and specifically thalamic function, is important for creative performance, and may be one crucial link between creativity and psychopathology. We suggest that decreased D2 receptor densities in the thalamus lower thalamic gating thresholds, thus increasing thalamocortical information flow. In healthy individuals, who do not suffer from the detrimental effects of psychiatric disease, this may increase performance on divergent thinking tests. In combination with the cognitive functions of higher order cortical networks, this could constitute a basis for the generative and selective processes that underlie real life creativity.},

Leading people to consider other members' thoughts and perspectives can reduce these egocentric (self-centered) judgments such that people claim that it is fair for them to take less; however, the consideration of others' thoughts and perspectives actually increases egoistic (selfish) behavior such that people actually take more of available resources. A series of experiments demonstrates this pattern in competitive contexts in which considering others' perspectives activates egoistic theories of their likely behavior, leading people to counter by behaving more egoistically themselves. This reactive egoism is attenuated in cooperative contexts.

Although Fechner's studies are often cited to support the centrality of the Golden Section, a century of subsequent experimental work suggests it has little normative role in rectangle preferences. However, rectangles are still of interest to experimental aesthetics, and McManus (1980) used a paired comparison method to show that although population preferences are weak, there are strong, stable, statistically robust and very varied individual preferences. The present study measured rectangle preferences in 79 participants, particularly assessing their relationship to a wide range of background measures of individual differences. Once again weak population preferences but strong and varied individual rectangle preferences were found, and computer presentation of stimuli, with detailed analyses of response times, confirmed the coherent nature of aesthetic preferences for rectangles. Q-mode factor analysis found two main factors, labeled " square" and " rectangle," with participants showing different combinations of positive and negative loadings on these factors. However, the individual difference measures, including Big Five personality traits, Need for Cognition, Tolerance of Ambiguity, Schizotypy, Vocational Types, and Aesthetic Activities, showed no correlation at all with rectangle preferences. Individual differences in rectangle preferences are a robust phenomenon that clearly requires explanation, but at present their variability is entirely unexplained. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Psychological Association.},

Recently, an intuitive functionalist account of forecasting biases has been proposed (Sackett {\&} Armor, 2010; see also Armor, Massey, {\&} Sackett, 2008), which posits that individuals flexibly shift between optimistic or pessimistic outlooks based on the perceived value of each outlook. The present research examines people's chronic motivational orientations as one factor that influences perceptions of the functional value of optimistic or pessimistic outlooks. Across three studies, we demonstrate that those primarily concerned with growth and advancement (i.e., promotion) prefer optimistic forecasts and perform better when adopting an optimistic outlook, whereas those primarily concerned with safety and security (i.e., prevention) prefer pessimistic forecasts and perform better when adopting a pessimistic outlook.},

abstract = {Results from recent event-related brain potential (ERP) studies investigating brain processes involved in the detection and analysis of emotional facial expression are reviewed. In all experiments, emotional faces were found to trigger an increased ERP positivity relative to neutral faces. The onset of this emotional expression effect was remarkably early, ranging from 120 to 180 ms post-stimulus in different experiments where faces were either presented at fixation or laterally, and with or without non-face distractor stimuli. While broadly distributed positive deflections beyond 250 ms post-stimulus have been found in previous studies for non-face stimuli, the early frontocentrally distributed phase of this emotional positivity is most likely face-specific. Similar emotional expression effects were found for six basic emotions, suggesting that these effects are not primarily generated within neural structures specialised for the automatic detection of specific emotions. Expression effects were eliminated when attention was directed away from the location of peripherally presented emotional faces, indicating that they are not linked to pre-attentive emotional processing. When foveal faces were unattended, expression effects were attenuated, but not completely eliminated. It is suggested that these ERP correlates of emotional face processing reflect activity within a neocortical system where representations of emotional content are generated in a task-dependent fashion for the adaptive intentional control of behaviour. Given the early onset of the emotion-specific effects reviewed here, it is likely that this system is activated in parallel with the ongoing evaluation of emotional content in the amygdala and related subcortical brain circuits. {\textcopyright}2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A variety of rules have been suggested for determining the sample size required to produce a stable solution when performing a factor or component analysis. The most popular rules suggest that sample size be determined as a function of the number of variables. These rules, however, lack both empirical support and a theoretical rationale. We used a Monte Carlo procedure to systematically vary sample size, number of variables, number of components, and component saturation (i.e., the magnitude of the correlation between the observed variables and the components) in order to examine the conditions under which a sample component pattern becomes stable relative to the population pattern. We compared patterns by means of a single summary statistic, g-2, and by means of direct pattern comparisons using the kappa statistic. Results indicated that, contrary to the popular rules, samples size as a function of the number of variables was not an important factor in determining stability. Component saturation and absolute sample size were the most important factors. To a lesser degree, the number of variables per component was also important, with variables per component producing more stable results.},

However, when we come to factor analysis and the stability of factor loadings, the rules of thumb concerning ratios of numbers of cases to variables appear to be of limited value. Indeed recent empirical evidence from studies which examine recovery of known factor structures at various sample sizes indicates that the stability of factor loadings is less a function of the sample size or ratio of cases to variables, and much more to do with the amount of {\{}{\&}{\}}quot;in-common{\{}{\&}{\}}quot; variance amongst variables available to be explained by a set of factors. For example, Guadagnoli and Velicer (1988) developed a formula for estimating the average distance between a hypothesised population factor loading and its sample value, given a sample size.

Why size matters

Larger samples are better than smaller samples (all other things being equal) because larger samples tend to minimize the probability of errors, maximize the accuracy of population estimates, and increase the generalizability of the results. Unfortunately, there are few sample size guidelines for researchers using EFA or PCA, and many of these have minimal empirical evidence (e.g., Guadagnoli {\{}{\&}{\}}amp; Velicer, 1988). 

This is problematic because statistical procedures that create optimized linear combinations of variables (such as multiple regression, canonical correlation, and EFA$\backslash$PCA) tend to {\{}{\&}{\}}quot;overfit{\{}{\&}{\}}quot; the data. This means that these procedures optimize the fit of the model the given data; yet no sample is perfectly reflective of the population. Thus, this overfitting can result in erroneous conclusions if models fit to one data set are applied to others. In multiple regression this manifests itself as inflated R2 (shrinkage) and mis-estimated variable regression coefficients (Cohen {\{}{\&}{\}}amp; Cohen, 1983, p. 106). In EFA or PCA this {\{}{\&}{\}}quot;overfitting{\{}{\&}{\}}quot; can result in erroneous conclusions in several ways, including the extraction of erroneous factors or mis-assignment of items to factors (e.g., Tabachnick {\{}{\&}{\}}amp; Fidell, 2001, p. 588)

The ultimate concern is error. At the end of the analysis, if one has too small a sample, errors of inference can easily occur, particularly with techniques such as EFA or PCA.

Unfortunately, there are few sample size guidelines for researchers using EFA or PCA, and many of these have minimal empirical evidence (e.g., Guadagnoli {\{}{\&}{\}}amp; Velicer, 1988). 

This is problematic because statistical procedures that create optimized linear combinations of variables (such as multiple regression, canonical correlation, and EFA{\$}\backslash{\$}PCA) tend to {\{}{\&}{\}}quot;overfit{\{}{\&}{\}}quot; the data. This means that these procedures optimize the fit of the model the given data; yet no sample is perfectly reflective of the population. Thus, this overfitting can result in erroneous conclusions if models fit to one data set are applied to others. In multiple regression this manifests itself as inflated R2 (shrinkage) and mis-estimated variable regression coefficients (Cohen {\{}{\&}{\}}amp; Cohen, 1983, p. 106). In EFA or PCA this {\{}{\&}{\}}quot;overfitting{\{}{\&}{\}}quot; can result in erroneous conclusions in several ways, including the extraction of erroneous factors or mis-assignment of items to factors (e.g., Tabachnick {\{}{\&}{\}}amp; Fidell, 2001, p. 588)

The ultimate concern is error. At the end of the analysis, if one has too small a sample, errors of inference can easily occur, particularly with techniques such as EFA or PCA.},

abstract = {Research has shown that cognition often relies on simplified heuristics; however, few studies have explored the role of heuristics in design. We propose that designers utilize specific heuristics to explore the problem space of potential concepts, leading to the generation of novel and creative solutions. Design heuristic use in the early stages of product conception was examined through a case study of an expert industrial designer working on a real-world project. Sequences of exploratory concept sketches were analyzed for evidence of design heuristic use in generating concepts. This case study uncovers design heuristics that promote variation in concepts and alter existing solutions, supporting the claim that expertise incorporates the use of heuristics to maximize creativity and diversity in designs. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Aesthetics has been the subject of long-standing debates by philosophers and psychologists alike. In psychology, it is generally agreed that aesthetic experience results froman interaction between perception, cognition, and emotion. By experimentalmeans, this triad has been studied in the field of experimental aesthetics, which aims to gain a better understanding of how aesthetic experience relates to fundamental principles of human visual perception and brain processes. Recently, researchers in computer vision have also gained interest in the topic, giving rise to the field of computational aesthetics. With computing hardware and methodology developing at a high pace, the modeling of perceptually relevant aspect of aesthetic stimuli has a huge potential. In this review, we present an overview of recent developments in computational aesthetics and how they relate to experimental studies. In the first part, we cover topics such as the prediction of ratings, style and artist identification as well as computational methods in art history, such as the detection of influences among artists or forgeries.We also describe currently used computational algorithms, such as classifiers and deep neural networks. In the second part, we summarize results from the field of experimental aesthetics and cover several isolated image properties that are believed to have a effect on the aesthetic appeal of visual stimuli. Their relation to each other and to findings from computational aesthetics are discussed. Moreover, we compare the strategies in the two fields of research and suggest that both fields would greatly profit from a joined research effort. We hope to encourage researchers from both disciplines to work more closely together in order to understand visual aesthetics from an integrated point of view.},

Stronger effects of self-beliefs are evident when assessing self-beliefs specific to the academic domain and when measures of self-beliefs and achievement are matched by domain (e.g. same subject area). Under these conditions, the relation of self-beliefs to later achievement meets or exceeds Cohen's (1988) definition of a small effect size.},

We propose to map this conceptualization onto underlying mental processes. Specifically, we propose that boredom be defined in terms of attention. That is, boredom is the aversive state that occurs when we (a) are not able to successfully engage attention with internal (e.g., thoughts or feelings) or external (e.g., environmental stimuli) information required for participating in satisfying activity, (b) are focused on the fact that we are not able to engage attention and participate in satisfying activity, and (c) attribute the cause of our aversive state to the environment. We believe that our definition of boredom fully accounts for the phenomenal experience of boredom, brings existing theories of boredom into dialogue with one another, and suggests specific directions for future research on boredom and attention.},

Here we use image representations derived from Con-volutional Neural Networks optimised for object recogni-tion, which make high level image information explicit. We introduce A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style that can sep-arate and recombine the image content and style of natural images. The algorithm allows us to produce new images of high perceptual quality that combine the content of an ar-bitrary photograph with the appearance of numerous well-known artworks. Our results provide new insights into the deep image representations learned by Convolutional Neu-ral Networks and demonstrate their potential for high level image synthesis and manipulation.},

In recent years, research has focused on the ratio of the width of the waist to the width of the hips (the waist-to-hip ratio (WHR). A low WHR (i.e. a curvaceous body) is believed to correspond to the optimal fat distribution for high fertility, and so this shape should be highly attractive. In this paper we present evidence that weight scaled for height (the body mass index (BMI)) is the primary determinant of sexual attractiveness rather than WHR. BMI is also strongly linked to health and reproductive potential. Furthermore, we show how covariation of apparent BMI and WHR in previous studies led to the overestimation of the importance of WHR in the perception of female attractiveness. Finally, we show how visual cues, such as the perimeter-area ratio (PAR), can provide an accurate and reliable index of an individual's BMI and could be used by an observer to differentiate between potential partners.},

Participants (N = 113) were assigned to 1 of 3 groups: single reading, immediate rereading, or rereading after a 1-week delay. Outcomes were consistent with the 2 predictions stated earlier. This article discusses the status of the levels-of-disruption hypothesis and alternative hypotheses based on the cognitive effort required to process texts.

abstract = {Functional neuroimaging studies of emotion processing consistently report amygdala activation. Most of these studies observed lateralized amygdala activity, indicative of a clear hemisphere-specific processing difference between the left and right amygdalae. Because individual studies use varying paradigms and are limited by statistical power and sensitivity, it has remained unclear whether the left or the right amygdala is more consistently involved in emotional processing. By combining results across 54 fMRI and PET studies in a metaanalysis, we sought to establish if a common pattern of lateralized amygdala activation exists. Our findings indicate that across studies, the left amygdala is more often activated than the right amygdala, suggesting different roles for the left and right amygdalae in emotional processing. Further analysis showed that this predominant left amygdala activation is not significantly related to stimulus type, task instructions, differential habituation rates of the left and right amygdalae or elaborate processing. The results are discussed in relation to methodological and theoretical issues regarding functional brain asymmetry. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {With the proliferation and ubiquity of information and communication technologies (ICTs), it is becoming imperative for individuals to constantly engage with these technologies in order to get work accomplished. Academic literature, popular press, and anecdotal evidence suggest that ICTs are responsible for increased stress levels in individuals (known as technostress). However, despite the influence of stress on health costs and productivity, it is not very clear which characteristics of ICTs create stress. We draw from IS and stress research to build and test a model of technostress. The person-environment fit model is used as a theoretical lens. The research model proposes that certain technology characteristics-like usability (usefulness, complexity, and reliability), intrusiveness (presenteeism, anonymity), and dynamism (pace of change)-are related to stressors (work overload, role ambiguity, invasion of privacy, work-home conflict, and job insecurity). Field data from 661 working professionals was obtained and analyzed. The results clearly suggest the prevalence of technostress and the hypotheses from the model are generally supported. Work overload and role ambiguity are found to be the two most dominant stressors, whereas intrusive technology characteristics are found to be the dominant predictors of stressors. The results open up new avenues for research by highlighting the incidence of technostress in organizations and possible interventions to alleviate it.},

@article{Desmeules2002,
abstract = {The aim of this paper is to provide a theoretical framework for the study of the impacts of marketing strategies on general happiness. The goal is to provide a road map to establish a link between constructs of consumer behavior and happiness. We will propose the intervention of a new construct that we will name "consumer happiness". The first application of the theoretical framework will be a look at high-variety strategies in marketing. We will try to identify areas for further empirical research that will complement extant efforts in the area. A researcher interested in the impact of variety (or freedom of choice) on the general well being of individuals would find a series of articles with startling findings. Indeed, it has been suggested that freedom of choice can be experienced as a form of tyranny (Schwartz 2000). Also, there has been empirical evidence that choice can be demotivating (Iyengar and Lepper 2000). A group of researchers also claims that happiness is a matter of choice (Schwartz et al. 2002). This latter example postulates that certain people (called "maximizers") are worse off with more choice. Lehmann (1998) suggests that when variety is concerned, there can possibly be too much of a good thing. The need for the development of a theoretical framework stems from a desire to study the impact of marketing strategies on happiness AND incorporate the different findings we just mentioned. The constructs we are trying to link marketing with are subjective in nature. Existing macromarketing frameworks for the study of the impacts of marketing strategies on life satisfaction are somehow too narrow to incorporate some of the findings. We present a theoretical framework (Figure 1) for the study of the relationship between marketing strategies and happiness and suggest the mediation of a proposed consumer happiness measure. We postulate that marketing strategies (marketing-mix strategies, high-variety strategies, mass customization or experience-shopping, etc.) influence (main effect) how people feel about their consumption possibilities and experiences (consumer happiness). For instance, distribution strategies influence the availability of goods directly and the creation of new channels such as online retailing improves the ease, availability and experience of shopping. We also presume that consumer happiness may or may not influence (as a main effect) either the affective (affect) or cognitive (life satisfaction) aspects of happiness. Consumer happiness is needed for the creation of an interactive effect between marketing strategies and happiness measures. We believe that consumer happiness should be measured via general questions so that respondents evaluate their satisfaction with consumption by doing their own "weighted average" of the experiences for which they attach significance. We present a graphical representation (inverted-"U" shaped) of the relationship between variety and the positiveness of a consumption experience when the evaluative task is performed by cognition (Figure 2). There are three sections to the curve on the graph: an upward sloping portion, a relatively flat plateau and a downward sloping portion. Two lines separate the three sections: satisfaction and regret identify their positions on the x-axis. This indicates that (full) satisfaction is obtained after some number of options. Adding an option adds to the positiveness of the experience since it allows a good chance of finding what one is looking for, and there is an open door for variety-seeking behavior (change). The "point of satisfaction" could be attained with one option alone, providing it fulfills the needs of the consumer. As satisfaction is reached, we enter a plateau section where options can be considered (or ignored) without much affecting the positiveness of the experience. At the end of the plateau, we find the "point of regret" where the curve starts to dive. We propose that there exist a point in the amount of variety where variety alone brings about doubt and regret avoidance mechanisms. After the point of regret, the positiveness of consumption experiences goes down because of stress, frustration, disengagement from the process, or anticipated/experienced regret caused by heightened expectations and/or an inability to conduct all the evaluations and calculations (mathematical or otherwise) necessary to arrive at a choice. Thus, even though we are past the point of satisfaction, the consumer perceived enough variety for its expectations to be heightened. Instead of simply ignoring other options, as suggested by rational choice theory, the consumer is "infected" by feelings of doubt, and the consumer experiences stress, frustration, regret, or opts for a disengagement from the process in front of anticipated regret. We conclude that marketing does seem to create some instances of unpleasant choices and unhappiness with decisions. However, several moderating factors can influence the undesirable effects. Thus, a positive role for marketing is to make sure that strategies do not lead to undesirable effects that can engender negative experiences. Marketing strategies (especially high-variety strategies) should be especially concerned with the effects on consumers' expectations. As we have discussed earlier, maximization tendencies are related to very negative consequences. Advertisers should be concerned that their message does not lead the consumer to hold unreasonable expectations about the advertised product. In addition, marketers should continue to offer information for consumers so that they can gain some expertise with the category. It is marketing's role, we believe, to educate consumers and provide the necessary information for people to make appropriate choices within a category.},

Our novel, dual-process approach to candidate perception sees voters as holding both conscious, explicit impressions of candidate traits and automatic, implicit candidate-trait associations that cannot be measured using traditional self-report techniques. We examine implicit candidate-trait associations for the first time using data from a three-wave online panel conducted in the last month of the 2012 U.S. presidential election. First, we demonstrate that implicit candidate-trait associations exist. Second, we show that implicit associations of warmth and competence with the candidates predict explicit candidate evaluations, economic evaluations, and vote choice, above and beyond conventional political science controls and explicit trait perceptions. Finally, we find that these effects are strongest among nonpartisans and partisans with conflicted feelings about their party's nominee. We suggest future directions for implicit political cognition research, including trait perception.},

In advisory roles, properly prepared design professionals could make substantial contributions to a process now dominated by political and economic views. This paper examines the nature of design thinking as it differs from other ways of thinking. A model for comparing fields is introduced and a number of characteristics of creative individuals in general and designers in particular are pre- sented. Preparing designers for participation in policy planning will be a challenge for design education. Meeting the challenge will require new understanding, an extended range of design tools, and concerted support from the design professions to demonstrate the value of design thinking to decision making at the highest levels.},

abstract = {Using data from the Berlin Speed Dating Study, we tested rival hypotheses concerning the effects of self-enhancement of attractiveness on dating outcomes. Three hundred eighty-two participants took part in one of the 17 speed-dating sessions. After each speed-dating interaction, participants indicated how interesting they found the respective person as a long-term and short-term partner. Using social relations analyses, we computed perceiver effects (being more or less choosy) and target effects (being rated as more or less interesting) of long-term and short-term partner ratings. Self-enhancement was operationalized as the discrepancy between self-rated attractiveness and four components of actual attractiveness (observer-rated facial and vocal attractiveness, height and body mass index). Results indicated that self-enhancers were less choosy with respect to their interest for short-term partners, which was especially true for men, but more choosy with respect to long-term partners. With regard to popularity as a mate, potential partners indicated that they found self-enhancers more interesting as short-term partners but not as long-term partners. As self-enhancement is a key component of narcissism, these results are consistent with findings that narcissists perceive many sexual affairs as an achievement, while preferring selected ‘trophy' long-term partners, and narcissists have a charming appeal for short-term, but not lasting, social relationships.

Emotion-based dispositions to rash action: positive and negative urgency. Psychological Bulletin, 134, 807-828], has been related to a wide range of maladaptive behaviours. The present study further investigates the role of urgency in problematic behaviours by considering distinct psychological mechanisms that may underlie this component of impulsivity. With this aim, 95 volunteer participants were screened with self-reported questionnaires assessing urgency and three problematic behaviours (compulsive buying, excessive mobile phone use, excessive Internet use). They performed two laboratory tasks: a stop-signal task designed to assess the capacity to inhibit prepotent responses in response to both neutral and emotional stimuli; and the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) measuring the ability to take into account the future consequences of an action. A poor ability to inhibit prepotent responses in the emotional condition of the stop-signal task was found to predict more disadvantageous choices in the IGT, which ultimately results in higher urgency and more problematic behaviours. These findings shed new light on the construct of urgency, its related psychological mechanisms, and its role in problematic behaviours. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

We employed a simple rank-order preference task using paintings and photographs of faces and landscapes. In each of the four stimulus classes, we find that aesthetic stability generally follows an inverted U-shaped function, with the greatest degree of stability appearing in early to middle adulthood. We propose that one possible interpretation of this result is that it indicates a role for cognitive control (i.e., the ability to adapt cognition to current situations) in the construction of aesthetic taste, since cognitive control performance follows a generally similar trajectory across the lifespan. However, human aesthetic stability is on the whole rather low: even the most stable age groups show ranking changes of at least 1 rank per item over a 2-week span. We discuss possible implications for these findings in terms of existing theories of visual aesthetics and in terms of methodological considerations, though we acknowledge that other interpretations of our results are possible.},

We first question whether metaanalytic procedures can be profitably applied to an area in which a relatively small number of studies manipulated a limited number of variables and yielded highly consistent results. We then contrast the meta-analytic approach of Mullen et al. with the experimental approach of Diehl and Stroebe to argue that Mullen et al.'s conclusion that the influence of procedural and economic mechanisms on the productivity loss in brainstorming is erroneous. It is proposed that Mullen et al.'s analysis does not allow such a conclusion because they merely examine the effects of four rather arbitrarily selected variables on the difference between real and nominal groups. Because real groups always work under blocking conditions-whereas blocking does not occur in nominal groups-their findings merely reflect the extent to which these variables modulate the central procedural mechanism.},

abstract = {The recent work of Gatys et al., who characterized the style of an image by the statistics of convolutional neural network filters, ignited a renewed interest in the texture generation and image stylization problems. While their image generation technique uses a slow optimization process, recently several authors have proposed to learn generator neural networks that can produce similar outputs in one quick forward pass. While generator networks are promising, they are still inferior in visual quality and diversity compared to generation-by-optimization. In this work, we advance them in two significant ways. First, we introduce an instance normalization module to replace batch normalization with significant improvements to the quality of image stylization. Second, we improve diversity by introducing a new learning formulation that encourages generators to sample unbiasedly from the Julesz texture ensemble, which is the equivalence class of all images characterized by certain filter responses. Together, these two improvements take feed forward texture synthesis and image stylization much closer to the quality of generation-via-optimization, while retaining the speed advantage.},

@article{Todorov2013,
abstract = {People often draw trait inferences from the facial appearance of other people. We investigated the minimal conditions under which people make such inferences. In five experiments, each focusing on a specific trait judgment, we manipulated the exposure time of unfamiliar faces. Judgments made after a 100-ms exposure correlated highly with judgments made in the absence of time constraints, suggesting that this exposure time was sufficient for participants to form an impression. In fact, for all judgments—attractiveness, likeability, trustworthiness, competence, and aggressiveness—increased exposure time did not significantly increase the correlations. When exposure time increased from 100 to 500 ms, participants' judgments became more negative, response times for judgments decreased, and confidence in judgments increased. When exposure time increased from 500 to 1,000 ms, trait judgments and response times did not change significantly (with one exception), but confidence increased for some of the judgments; this result suggests that additional time may simply boost confidence in judgments. However, increased exposure time led to more differentiated person impressions.},

abstract = {Recent studies have shown remarkable success in image-to-image translation for two domains. However, existing approaches have limited scalability and robustness in handling more than two domains, since different models should be built independently for every pair of image domains. To address this limitation, we propose StarGAN, a novel and scalable approach that can perform image-to-image translations for multiple domains using only a single model. Such a unified model architecture of StarGAN allows simultaneous training of multiple datasets with different domains within a single network. This leads to StarGAN's superior quality of translated images compared to existing models as well as the novel capability of flexibly translating an input image to any desired target domain. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a facial attribute transfer and a facial expression synthesis tasks.},

In addition, the article integrates these concepts through a suggested causal framework. Students evaluated either a high- or a low-involvement product in current use, reported affective responses evoked by it, and assessed their levels of product-derived satisfaction. Analysis shows that two primary dimensions of product evaluation-utilitarian and hedonic judgment-can be viewed as causally antecedent to two dimensions of affect-pleasantness and arousal-and to product satisfaction. Implications of the conceptual framework and empirical findings for the study of consumption events are discussed.},

In the second stage of the experiment we measure, for a sample of the recruiters involved, their explicit and implicit attitudes/performance stereotypes by the means of explicit questions and the implicit association test (IAT). We find (i) only weak correlations between explicit attitudes/performance stereotypes and implicit performance stereotypes but (ii) a strong and statistically significant negative correlation between the implicit performance stereotypes and the callback rate for an interview for applicants with Arab/Muslim sounding names, but not for applicants with Swedish sounding names.

The proposed model is built based on a value-intention framework and tested in the context of financial investment decisions. The results indicate that a low level of perceived expertise in financial management, a large amount of total financial assets, and a high opportunity cost of time enhance the perceived value of information intermediaries, thus increasing the likelihood of using information intermediaries. We also find that the use of information intermediaries is positively associated with the overall extent of information search and influences the likelihood of using other information sources.},

An exploratory factor analyses of these items revealed distinct, internally consistent scales reflecting the strategies of Self-Consequating, Environmental Control, Performance Self-Talk, Mastery Self-Talk, and Interest Enhancement. Self-report measures of effort, use of six cognitive and metacognitive learning strategies, and teacher-reported grades were also collected. Findings revealed mean level differences in students' reported use of the motivational strategies. In addition, results from a series of multivariate regressions indicated that students' use of motivational regulation strategies could be used to predict their use of learning strategies, effort, and classroom performance. As a whole, findings support the belief that motivational self-regulation should be integrated more completely into current models of volition and self-regulated learning.},

abstract = {Mindfulness—present moment attention and awareness (Brown {\&} Ryan, 2003)—is commonly proposed as a productive state of consciousness in the workplace. Unfortunately, being mindful at every moment of the workday is fairly uncommon. Research suggests that people engage in mind wandering —a lack of attention to and awareness of the present (Smallwood {\&} Schooler, 2006)—for the majority of their day (in every task except making love; Killingsworth {\&} Gilbert, 2010). Further, there is another state of consciousness called flow —an intense sense of concentration and control over activities—that has also been linked to workplace performance (Nakamura {\&} Csikszentmihalyi, 2002). Interestingly, whereas mindfulness facilitates higher performance by being aware of external stimuli, flow enables higher performance by doing the opposite—blocking out external stimuli. These findings suggest that mindfulness is neither the most common psychological state nor the only productive psychological state for the workplace.},

Individual differences in self-esteem were variable across cultures, with a neutral response bias prevalent in more collectivist cultures. Self-competence and self-liking subscales of the RSES varied with cultural individualism. Although positively and negatively worded items of the RSES were correlated within cultures and were uniformly related to external personality variables, differences between aggregates of positive and negative items were smaller in developed nations.

Inmany scientific disciplines, the goal of researchers is not only estimating causal effects of a treatment but also understanding the process in which the treatment causally affects the outcome. Causal mediation analysis is fre- quently used to assess potential causal mechanisms. The mediation package implements a comprehensive suite of statistical tools for conducting such an analysis. The package is organized into two distinct approaches. Using the model-based approach, researchers can estimate causal mediation effects and conduct sensitivity analysis under the stan- dard research design. Furthermore, the design-based approach provides several analysis tools that are applicable under different experimental designs. This approach requires weaker assumptions than the model-based approach. Finally, we also implement a statis- tical method for dealing with multiple (causally dependent) mediators, which are often encountered in practice.},

We initially collected data from 762 undergraduate students. Of these, 314 qualified as "gamers" and were included in our analysis. Participants completed the DFS-2 based on their personal gaming experiences and the data was subjected to factor analysis. We did not find the DFS-2 to be an adequate measure of flow for the game experience and that continued examination of the construct and measure refinement is necessary. {\textcopyright}2012 Elsevier Ltd.

When using "direct" ingroup bias strategies, high-self-esteem individuals showed more bias than did low-self-esteem individuals. When using "indirect" strategies, groups exhibited comparable amounts of bias. Results were comparable for collective and personal self-esteem measures. Examination of specific collective measures indicated that self-esteem defined by the Collective Self-Esteem Scale (Luhtanen {\&} Crocker, 1992) did not predict differences in ingroup bias, whereas group identification measures did predict differences in ingroup bias. Results are interpreted as indicating that both high and low-self-esteem individuals exhibit ingroup bias; however, expression of ingroup bias by individuals with low self-esteem is constrained by situational factors. Furthermore, individual-level factors such as personal self-esteem may be useful in predicting collective enhancement.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to identify and explore the cognitive decision-making styles used by small business owners across a range of Australian businesses. Primary data were gathered randomly from a sample of micro and small business owners using an electronic survey populated by items taken from three existing questionnaires. Earlier findings showed that managers use both intuition and rational information processing styles, paired with both local and global and organizing styles. The former were identified as complementary and used simultaneously in decision-making. The global information organizing style was also found to be linked positively with intuition. Unlike earlier studies of cognitive styles, information processing and global thinking were context-dependent, whereas local thinking was context-independent. However, their hypothesized relationship with the environment and its moderating effects on performance were only partially supported. Several ambiguous relationships need to be addressed in future studies of cognitive styles, including those between intuition and financial performance, style and strategy, and cognitive processing and organizing. The sample was both numerically and geographically constrained. More comprehensive research needs to address these issues. Context dependency suggests that thinking styles are learnable, and as such, may be useful for entrepreneurial self-development for improved decision making and more effective commercial performance. Despite some interest in the area of cognitive decision making, the present study focused on micro and small businesses; much extant associated activity has only been forthcoming in larger organizations. Additionally, this research verifies the role of intuition in decision making and confirms the position of logical thinking. {\textcopyright} Common Ground, Darren Lee-Ross, All Rights Reserved.},

We first address concerns raised by philosophers regarding the possibility, desirability, and justifiability of happiness and then turn to the perennial question of how to be happy. Integrating insights from great thinkers of the past with empirical findings from modern behavioral sciences, we review the conditions and causes of happiness.

abstract = {Some philosophers of science and social scientists disapprove of using empathy in human inquiry. Empathy would be neither sufficient nor necessary for understanding another person. In this article, the insufficiency of empathy will be recognized, but the necessity of empathy for interpersonal understanding in everyday life, situations of professional care, and certain forms of human inquiry, especially qualitative research, will be supported. However, empathic understanding should not be conceived as pure psychic identification, but rather as putting oneself imaginatively into the experiential world of another person with the aim to understand the other. Emotional resonance is not only an early phase of it, but also a basic facet. A comprehensive conceptualization of empathic understanding is developed, which makes empathy more worthwhile in professional contexts. Empathic understanding is conceived as a two-dimensional concept. The mental dimension refers to affective, cognitive, and interpretive facets or phases of empathic understanding and the social dimension refers to expressive, responsive, and interactive facets or phases of empathic understanding. These two dimensions are crosswise combined and the most optimal form of empathic understanding is called ‘‘dialogical-hermeneutical empathic understanding.'' In addition, the importance of imagination and the development of it for optimal empathic understanding are elaborated.},

In this study, professional engineers from a manufacturing company participated in a small group innovation workshop using the developed "Design Heuristics." The team was videotaped as they worked with the instructional cards we developed based on the heuristics. This paper reports on the investigation of the design team's idea generation process with five of the cards, analyzing the diversity of their ideas, how Design Heuristics were used, and their role in stimulating both new design solutions and problems. The introduction of a specific design heuristic often guided designers to a different part of the design space, and facilitated them in considering other unprompted heuristics.},

The divergent-thinking groups scored significantly higher than controls on the story-telling, story-writing, and poetry-writing tasks.

It integrates human, business and technical factors in problem forming, solving and design: "Design Thinking." This human-centric methodology integrates expertise from design, social sciences, business and engineering. It is best implemented by high performance project teams applying diverse points-of-view simultaneously. It creates a vibrant interaction environment that promotes iterative learning cycles driven by rapid conceptual prototyping. The methodology has proven successful in the creation of innovative products, systems, and services. Through courting ambiguity, we can let invention happen even if we cannot make it happen. We can nurture a corpus of behaviors that increase the probability of finding a path to innovation in the face of uncertainty. Emphasis is placed on balance of the questions we ask, and the decisions made. A suite of application examples and research finding will be used to illustrate the concepts in principal and in action.'' [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

We present a computer-assisted literature review, where we utilize both text mining and qualitative coding, and analyze 6,996 papers from Scopus. We find that the roots of sentiment analysis are in the studies on public opinion analysis at the beginning of 20th century and in the text subjectivity analysis performed by the computational linguistics community in 1990's. However, the outbreak of computer-based sentiment analysis only occurred with the availability of subjective texts on the Web. Consequently, 99{\%} of the papers have been published after 2004. Sentiment analysis papers are scattered to multiple publication venues, and the combined number of papers in the top-15 venues only represent ca. 30{\%} of the papers in total. We present the top-20 cited papers from Google Scholar and Scopus and a taxonomy of research topics. In recent years, sentiment analysis has shifted from analyzing online product reviews to social media texts from Twitter and Facebook.

abstract = {Product designers seek to create novel designs that elicit aesthetic responses from consumers. In this paper, we re-visited the much investigated relationship between novelty and aesthetic preference, but also with a new focus on what constitutes novelty in product design. Based on prior research on consumer's perception of product appearance, we included three fundamental dimensions of product semantics - trendiness, complexity, and emotion - in our study, and investigated their influences on novelty and aesthetic preference. We selected 88 chairs that are highly varied in shape but correspond to a common prototype - a chair with back support and without arms - as stimuli. We then conducted a semantic differential study on the 88 chairs, where trendiness, complexity, and emotion were measured by using bipolar adjectives "traditional-modern", "simple-complex", and "rational-emotional", respectively, while novelty and aesthetic preference were evaluated by using the bipolar adjectives "typical-unique" and "beautiful-ugly", respectively. The results confirm Berlyne's hypothesis that the relationship between novelty and aesthetic preference resembles an inverted-U curve, where the chairs perceived to be most beautiful are those with a moderate level of novelty. Each of the three dimensions - trendiness, complexity, and emotion - forms a positive linear relationship with novelty. This result shows that the three fundamental dimensions of product semantic can be regarded as predictor variables for novelty; of the three dimensions, trendiness has the greatest influence, followed by complexity, and finally by emotion. The three dimensions influence aesthetic preference differently: both complexity and emotion exhibit inverted-U relationships with aesthetic preference, while trendiness has a small positive linear relationship with aesthetic preference. {\textcopyright} 2012 Hung {\&} Chen.},

Preadolescence has been proposed as a period that is crucial for training these abilities. The present pilot study investigated the effects of mindfulness training on preadolescents‘ regulatory abilities and school-related outcomes. A group of 34 fifth graders received either mindfulness training (experimental group), Marburg Concentration Training (alternative treatment group), or no treatment (passive control group) and were monitored over a four-month intervention period. Regulatory abilities were assessed first, with two self-report questionnaires that operationalized impulsivity and coping with stress, respectively. Second, physical stress regulation was examined on the basis of diurnal cortisol as well as salivary {\$}\alpha{\$}-amylase (sAA) profiles. Finally, school-related outcomes were measured with a paperpencil based performance test of verbal memory. Results show that impulsivity increased in all groups over time, whereas there were no significant training effects on self-reported coping with stress. Both training groups showed more adaptive physiological stress regulation in terms of steeper diurnal cortisol slopes and marginally less pronounced sAA awakening responses, however, with respect to physiological measures, no data of the passive control group are available. With respect to school-related outcomes, the results indicate a slight superiority regarding verbal memory for the mindfulness training group compared to the Marburg Concentration Training group.},

This study examines the possibility that the relation between creativity and implementation is regulated by individuals' motivation to put their ideas into practice and their ability to network, or, alternatively, the number of strong relationships they maintain. Using data from 216 employees and their supervisors, results indicated that individuals were able to improve the otherwise negative odds of their creative ideas being realized when they expected positive outcomes to be associated with their implementation efforts and when they were skilled networkers or had developed a set of strong "buy-in" relationships.},

@article{Lester1998,
abstract = {The past two decades have seen a dramatic acceleration in the pace of marketplace change. Companies have abandoned the old hierarchical model, with its clean functional divisions and clear lines of authority, and adopted flatter, less bureaucratic structures. But if most organizations have begun to adapt to the uncertainty of rapid change, most managers have not. They remain locked into the mechanical mind-set of the industrial age--that is, they assume that any management challenge can be translated into a clearly defined problem for which an optimal solution can be found. That approach works in stable markets and even in markets that change in predictable ways. Today's markets, however, are increasingly unstable and unpredictable. Managers can never know precisely what they're trying to achieve or how best to achieve it. They can't even define the problem, much less engineer a solution. The challenges facing the general manager in these circumstances, the authors argue, resemble those typically confronted by design managers. In the unpredictable world of research and design, neither the flow of the development process nor its end point can be defined at the outset. Rather than the traditional analytical approach to management, the design world requires an interpretive one. And that approach is equally well suited to rapidly changing, unpredictable markets. The authors describe how companies such as Levi Strauss {\&} Company and Chiron Corporation have stayed at the top of their industries by adopting just such an interpretive approach to management.},

This article presents a 2-component model within which the literature regarding impression management is reviewed. This model conceptualizes impression management as being composed of 2 discrete processes. The 1st involves impression motivation-the degree to which people are motivated to control how others see them. Impression motivation is conceptualized as a function of 3 factors: the goal-relevance of the impressions one creates, the value of desired outcomes, and the discrepancy between current and desired images. The 2nd component involves impression construction. Five factors appear to determine the kinds of impressions people try to construct: the self-concept, desired and undesired identity images, role constraints, target's values, and current social image. The 2-component model provides coherence to the literature in the area, addresses controversial issues, and supplies a framework for future research regarding impression management.},

In all studies, Ss watched a staged crime; immediately afterwards, they were asked to identify the culprit from a photospread and to indicate their confidence in that judgment. 
In an RSA condition, Ss also viewed a videotape of their performance before rating their confidence. Collectively, the results show an average correlation of .04 in the control groups and .48 in the RSA condition. 
The data tentatively support a self-perception hypothesis that this manipulation is effective because it alerts Ss to valid but previously unobserved aspects of their own overt behavior (e.g., response latency). Findings are discussed for their theoretical and forensic implications.},

Consider that a cross-cultural psychologist and a cognitive neuroscientist meeting at a professional conference might know next to nothing about the phenomena and theories that are important in each other's work. Yet they would certainly both know about the difference between an experiment and a correlational study, the function of independent and dependent variables, the importance of reliability and validity in psychological measurement, and the need for replication in psychological research. In other words, psychologists' research methods are at the very core of their discipline. At the same time, most students majoring in psychology do not go on to graduate school. And among those who do, only a fraction become cross-cultural psychologists, cognitive neuroscientists, or researchers of any sort. The rest pursue careers in clinical practice, social services, and a wide variety of fields that may be completely unrelated to psychology. For these students, the study of research methods is important primarily because it prepares them to be effective consumers of psychological research and because it promotes critical thinking skills and attitudes that are applicable in many areas of life.

abstract = {The interplay between feeling and thinking has been a subject of scholarly discussion and spirited debate since antiquity. The last few decades have witnessed a mounting interest in the impact of affective or mood states on learn- ing, memory, decision making, and allied cognitive processes. Much of this interest has initially focused on two phenomena: mood-congruent cognition—the observation that a given mood promotes the processing of informa- tion that possesses a similar affective tone or valence, and mood-dependent memory—the observation that information encoded in a particular mood is most retrievable in that mood, irrespective of the information's affective valence. More recently, and especially since the publication of the previous edition of this Handbook, numerous studies have found that positive and negative moods can also influence memory due to their effects on information processing styles or strategies. This chapter examines the history and current status of research on mood congruence, mood dependence, and mood effects on processing strategies, with a view to clarifying what is known about each of these phenomena, and why they are worth knowing about},

abstract = {It is striking that prosocial people are considered "sweet" (e.g., "she's a sweetie") because they are unlikely to differentially taste this way. These metaphors aid communication, but theories of conceptual metaphor and embodiment led us to hypothesize that they can be used to derive novel insights about personality processes. Five studies converged on this idea. Study 1 revealed that people believed strangers who liked sweet foods (e.g., candy) were also higher in agreeableness. Studies 2 and 3 showed that individual differences in the preference for sweet foods predicted prosocial personalities, prosocial intentions, and prosocial behaviors. Studies 4 and 5 used experimental designs and showed that momentarily savoring a sweet food (vs. a nonsweet food or no food) increased participants' self-reports of agreeableness and helping behavior. The results reveal that an embodied metaphor approach provides a complementary but unique perspective to traditional trait views of personality.},

Individuals studied two lists of paired associates under instructions to use either a normatively effective strategy (interactive imagery) or a normatively ineffective strategy (rote repetition) for each pair. Questionnaire ratings of imagery effectiveness increased and ratings of repetition effectiveness decreased after task experience, demonstrating new knowledge about strategy effectiveness. Cued recall confidence judgments, measuring confidence in recall accuracy, were almost perfectly correlated with actual recall and strongly correlated with postdictions-estimates of recall for each strategy. A structural regression model revealed that postdictions mediated both changes in second-list predictions and changes in strategy effectiveness ratings, implicating accurate performance estimates based on item-level monitoring as the key to updating strategy knowledge. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

While exploratory in nature, this study aims to identify and offer a meaningful understanding of different segments of young luxury consumers in China. Design/methodology/approach – The data were obtained from personal interviews with 28 respondents between 20 and 25 years of age who were recruited via a mall-interception method in three different high-end department stores in Shanghai, China. Findings – Based on key values, motivations, and behavior patterns toward luxury consumption, the authors identify four distinct segments of young luxury consumers: the overseas pack; the self-established cool; the luxury followers; and the spirituals. Research limitations/implications – The study is based on a small sample consisting of 28 individuals. Practical implications – While Chinese youth may share some traits as a collective group, they also have diverse reasons and patterns for luxury consumption. The authors identify at least four distinct segments whose values, motivations and behavior toward luxury are different from one another. Companies must consider the differences that exist within this generation to effectively approach this market. Originality/value – While exploratory, the current study is the first to identify segments in luxury consumers among young generations in China.},

abstract = {We often desire our models to be interpretable as well as accurate. Prior work on optimizing models for interpretability has relied on easy-to-quantify proxies for interpretability, such as sparsity or the number of operations required. In this work, we optimize for interpretability by directly including humans in the optimization loop. We develop an algorithm that minimizes the number of user studies to find models that are both predictive and interpretable and demonstrate our approach on several data sets. Our human subjects results show trends towards different proxy notions of interpretability on different datasets, which suggests that different proxies are preferred on different tasks.},

abstract = {Four studies examined the construct validity of two global self-esteem measures. In Studies 1 through 3, the Single-Item Self-Esteem Scale (SISE) and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSE) showed strong convergent validity for men and women, for different ethnic groups, and for both college students and community members. The SISE and the RSE had nearly identical correlations with a wide range of criterion measures, including domain-specific self-evaluations, self-evaluative biases, social desirability, personality, psychological and physical health, peer ratings of group behavior, academic outcomes, and demographic variables. Study 4 showed that the SISE had only moderate convergent validity in a sample of children. Overall, the findings support the reliability and validity of the SISE and suggest it can provide a practical alternative to the RSE in adult samples. More generally, the findings contribute to the research literature by further elaborating the nomological network of global self-esteem.},

Despite considerable evidence to the contrary, this remains widely accepted and for nearly a century has left the issue of whether visceral afferent signals are essential for emotional experience unresolved. Here we combine functional magnetic resonance imaging and multiorgan physiological recording to dissect experience of two distinct disgust forms and their relationship to peripheral and central physiological activity. We show that experience of core and body-boundary-violation disgust are dissociable in both peripheral autonomic and central neural responses and also that emotional experience specific to anterior insular activity encodes these different underlying patterns of peripheral physiological responses. These findings demonstrate that organ-specific physiological responses differentiate emotional feeling states and support the hypothesis that central representations of organism physiological homeostasis constitute a critical aspect of the neural basis of feelings.},

Groups can potentially generate more and better ideas when 'brainwriting'; that is, silently sharing written ideas in a time- and sequence-structured group format. This conceptual paper identifies likely boundary conditions to the promising findings from brainwriting laboratory research generalizing to real-world organizational contexts. Important dimensions of organizational context may be revealed by drawing on the journalistic principle to examine what, who, when, where, and why certain outcomes result from particular organizational practices (Johns, 2006). Multiple potential contextual moderators are suggested in each of these five areas. Subsequent field research will inform the idea-generation literature as well as those concerned with eliciting high-quality, useful ideas to address particular organizational and societal challenges.},

abstract = {The paper proposes a novel cognitive architecture (CA) for computational creativity based on the Psi model and on the mechanisms inspired by dual process theories of reasoning and rationality. In recent years, many cognitive models have focused on dual process theories to better describe and implement complex cognitive skills in artificial agents, but creativity has been approached only at a descriptive level. In previous works we have described various modules of the cognitive architecture that allows a robot to execute creative paintings. By means of dual process theories we refine some relevant mechanisms to obtain artworks, and in particular we explain details about resolution level of the CA dealing with different strategies of access to the Long Term Memory (LTM) and managing the interaction between S1 and S2 processes of the dual process theory. The creative process involves both divergent and convergent processes in either implicit or explicit manner. This leads to four activities (exploratory, reflective, tacit, and analytic) that, triggered by urges and motivations, generate creative acts. These creative acts exploit both the LTM and the WM in order to make novel substitutions to a perceived image by properly mixing parts of pictures coming from different domains. The paper highlights the role of the interaction between S1 and S2 processes, modulated by the resolution level which focuses the attention of the creative agent by broadening or narrowing the exploration of novel solutions, or even drawing the solution from a set of already made associations. An example of artificial painter is described in some experimentations by using a robotic platform.},

@article{Barrett2007,
abstract = {For journal editors, reviewers, and readers of research articles, structural equation model (SEM) fit has recently become a confusing and contentious area of evaluative methodology. Proponents of two kinds of approaches to model fit can be identified: those who adhere strictly to the result from a null hypothesis significance test, and those who ignore this and instead index model fit as an approximation function. Both have principled reasons for their respective course of action. This paper argues that the chi-square exactfit test is the only substantive test of fit for SEM, but, its sensitivity to discrepancies from expected values at increasing sample sizes can be highly problematic if those discrepancies are considered trivial from an explanatory-theory perspective. On the other hand, suitably scaled indices of approximate fit do not possess this sensitivity to sample size, but neither are they "tests" of model fit. The proposed solution to this dilemma is to consider the substantive "consequences" of accepting one explanatory model over another in terms of the predictive accuracy of theory-relevant-criteria. If there are none to be evaluated, then it is proposed that no scientifically worthwhile distinction between "competing" models can thus be made, which of course begs the question as to why such a SEM application was undertaken in the first place.},

We then employ a labeled topic model to jointly model both the tweets and the network structure to assign each node and each edge a topic respectively. This Semantic Stock Network (SSN) summarizes discussion topics about stocks and stock relations. We further show that social sentiment about stock (node) topics and stock relationship (edge) topics are predictive of each stock's market. For prediction, we propose to regress the topic-sentiment time-series and the stock's price time series. Experimental results demonstrate that topic sentiments from close neighbors are able to help improve the prediction of a stock markedly.},

Generating novel ideas is a challenging part of engineering design, especially when the design task has been undertaken for an extended period of time. How can experienced designers develop new ideas for familiar problems? A tool called Design Heuristics provides strategies that support engineers in considering more, and more different, concepts during idea generation. Design Heuristics have been shown to help novice engineers create a set of more diverse and creative candidate concepts. In this case study, we extended this approach to a group of professional engineers who had worked on a specific product line for many years. In a workshop format, a small group of engineers worked with the heuristics in two separate sessions and generated ideas collaboratively. Video recordings were analyzed to reveal how the heuristics were used to stimulate new designs for their product line. We found that Design Heuristics bring order in ideas and elaboration on ideas, perhaps through coordinating effort on idea evaluation, increasing capacity to improve the ideas of others, and facilitating interaction between participants. This case study shows using Design Heuristics can assist even expert engineers to increase the variety of concepts generated, resulting in a larger set of ideas to consider.},

Moreover, since people pay for participating in such events, aside from the overall quality of the dates, it is important to find a fair schedule, where people from the same group (e.g., all women) have a comparable number of dates.

We report here our investigation into the hypothesis that the human amygdala is required for accurate social judgments ofother individuals on the basis oftheir facial appearance. We asked three subjects with complete bilateral amygdala damage to judge faces ofunfamiliar people with respect to two attributes important in real-life social encounters: approachability and trustworthiness. All three subjects judged unfamiliar individuals to be more approachable and more trust- worthy than did control subjects. The impairment was most striking for faces to which normal subjects assign the most negative ratings: unapproachable and untrustworthy looking individuals. Additional investigations revealed that the impair- ment does not extend to judging verbal descriptions of people. The amygdala appears to be an important component of the neural systems that help retrieve socially relevant knowledge on the basis of facial appearance.},

Two sets containing 127 standardized photos of reptiles were developed, with one species per each subfamily. Respondents were asked to rate the animals according to fear, disgust, and beauty on a seven-point Likert scale. Evaluation of reptile species shows that people tend to perceive them as two clearly distinct groups based on their similar morphotype. In a subset of lizards, there was a positive correlation between fear and disgust, while disgust and fear were both negatively correlated with beauty. Surprisingly, a positive correlation between fear and beauty of snakes was revealed, i.e., the most feared species also tend to be perceived as beautiful.

abstract = {Certain facial expressions have been theorized to be easily recognizable signals of specific emotions. If so, these expressions should override situationally based expectations used by a person in attributing an emotion to another. An alternative account is offered in which the face provides information relevant to emotion but does not signal a specific emotion. Therefore, in specified circumstances, situational rather than facial information was predicted to determine the judged emotion. This prediction was supported in 3 studies--indeed, in each of the 22 cases examined (e.g., a person in a frightening situation but displaying a reported "facial expression of anger" was judged as afraid). Situational information was especially influential when it suggested a nonbasic emotion (e.g., a person in a painful situation but displaying a "facial expression of fear" was judged as in pain).},

abstract = {Structural equation modeling allows several methods of estimating the disattenuated association between 2 or more latent variables (i.e., the measurement model). In one common approach, measurement models are specified using item parcels as indicators of latent constructs. Item parcels versus original items are often used as indicators in these contexts to avoid estimation problems or solve issues associated with multivariate normality of the data. One concern associated with the use of item parceling is that no single "correct" approach exists to construct the parcels. Despite the controversy associated with selecting the most appropriate parceling method, less is understood with regard to how these methods influence the structural or path coefficients. By means of simulated and empirical data, this article addresses some commonly used strategies to model disattenuated structural coefficients between latent variables. Results revealed that when a single unidimensional scale is used to represent a latent construct, the use of individual items, item parcels, or an appropriate representation of measurement error through a single observed variable all will result in identical disattenuated structural coefficient estimates. Implications for the future of item parceling are discussed.},

In this study we conceptualized both influences in terms of a single underlying mechanism, construct accessibility. We pitted the characteristic ways that individuals perceive others against situational influences on accessibility (i.e., contextual priming) and tracked over time the relative power of these competing influences on the outcome of an impression-formation task. Ss possessed either a chronically accessible (chronics) or an inaccessible (nonchronics) construct for either outgoing or inconsiderate behavior. As the delay since the priming event lengthened (from 15 to 180 s), chronics were progressively more likely to use the chronically accessible construct instead of the primed alternative construct to categorize an ambiguous target behavior, whereas nonchronics' relative use of the primed and alternative constructs did not change as a function of postpriming delay.},

annote = {Note1
Latent variables that are modeled with parcels that share systematic error become
defined, in part, by that systematic error. Measures that include variance associated

with a core construct of interest and shared systematic error are thereby
confounded, resulting in a confounded latent construct. In interpreting relations
with this construct, relations among the confounded latent variable and other constructs
in one's model will reflect the influence of the core construct we intended to

measure, the systematic error, or a combination of the two, leading to problematic
interpretation. With confounded latent variables, we should expect latent relations
to be underestimated when the systematic error is not present in other latent variables,
but we should expect the correlations to be overestimated when the systematic
error is shared in other variables. When such sources of systematic error are
spread across parcels, this error becomes part of the latent construct.


As we have already noted, parcel-based models attempt to cancel out random
and systematic error by aggregating across these errors, thereby improving model
fit (Bagozzi {\{}{\&}{\}}amp; Edwards, 1998; Bagozzi {\{}{\&}{\}}amp; Heatherton, 1994). The advantages and
appropriateness of this approach to increasing model fit is controversial (e.g., Hall,
Snell, {\{}{\&}{\}}amp; Foust, 1999). Bandalos and Finney (2001) argued that parceling would
improve model fit for all models, correctly specified or not. As such, parceling may
reduce our ability to identify misspecified models and may increase our Type II error
rate (failing to reject a model that should be rejected). For example, Bandalos
(1997) found that parceling could mask double loadings of items.

Generally speaking, parceling can hide many forms of misspecification, at least
misspecification that would be found if analyses were performed on item-level
data.},

for the research purposes. In the large ocean of postings and the

is evaluating the teacher in an academic institution, a product reviewer
who is reviewing and commenting on the product, the client feedback

the foundation of students and other so many areas. Facebook is a very
famous and common platform where youth feels comfortable to share their
views in form of comments in textual form. We had tried to develop a
tool on python language using three classifiers MNNB, RF and SVC to
predicting or identifying the personality of students on social media
using four labels including ``sad{\{}''{\}}, ``angry{\{}''{\}} (at negative side)
and ``happy{\{}''{\}}, ``relax{\{}''{\}} (at positive side). A design-based approach
has been used based on a dataset extracted from social media
self-created page(s) where students of different mind-set were invited

Currently no literature indicates that the JD-R model has been used to predict work-based identity.Research design: A census-based survey was conducted amongst a target population of 23134 employees that yielded a sample of 2429 (a response rate of about 10.5{\%}). The Job Demands- Resources scale (JDRS) was used to measure job demands and job resources. A work-based identity scale was developed for this study. Work engagement was studied with the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES). Factor and reliability analyses were conducted on the scales and general multiple regression models were used in the predictive analyses.Main findings: The JD-R model yielded a greater amount of variance in dedication than in work engagement. It, however, yielded the greatest amount of variance in work-based identity, with job resources being its strongest predictor.Practical/managerial implications: Identification and work engagement levels can be improved by managing job resources and demands.Contribution/value-add: This study builds on the literature of the JD-R model by showing that it can be used to predict work-based identity.},

Based on extant empirical and theoretical work, two models were tested. findings from a sample of 41 production teams (174 team members) showed support for the mediation model?that autonomy is associated with performance and strain through teamwork KSAs. The alternative moderation model, suggesting that autonomy and teamwork KSAs interact in predicting performance and strain, was not supported.},

a{\{}{\_}{\}}autonomy
The degree to which teams were involved in managing
their own work activities was assessed by a three-item scale,
based on Little (1989) and Sprigg, Jackson, and Parker (2000). 
Items included 
Are team members themselves involved in making decisions about setting goals and targets?
Are most job-related decisions made by team members rather than by just the shift manager?

The five-point response scale ranged from 1 ?not at all? to 5 ?a great deal?. Internal consistency reliability
(Cronbach?s alpha) was .78.

a{\{}{\_}{\}}performance
Team Performance. Team performance was assessed through managerial
ratings. These were obtained by using four items from the 
?work unit effectiveness? (WUE) scale developed by Uhl-Bien and Graen (1998). 
Items included 
?How good is the team at achieving its goals?? and 
?How would you rate the performance of the team as a whole?? 
Responses were recorded
on a five-point response scale ranging from 1 ?very poor? to 5 ?very good?.
Cronbach?s alpha was .86. Managers rated teams at about the same time as
employees completed the teamwork KSA test and other measures. The
measure was administered in one of three ways, reflecting the preferences
and ?political sensitivities? of different managers. For 16 of the teams (8
from Company A and 8 from Company B) team performance was calculated
as the mean of individual manager ratings (each manager rated the
performance of their own team and that of at least two others with which
they were most familiar).},

We examine how embodiment is used in social psychology, and we explore the ways in which embodied approaches enrich traditional theories. Although research in this area is burgeoning, much of it has been more descriptive than explanatory. We provide a critical discussion of the trajectory of embodiment research in social psychology. We contend that future researchers should engage in a phenomenon-based approach, highlight the theoretical boundary conditions and mediators involved, explore novel action-relevant outcome measures, and address the role of individual differences broadly defined. Such research will likely provide a more explanatory account of the role of embodiment in general terms as well as how it expands the knowledge base in social psychology.},

However, their methods requires a slow and memory-consuming optimization process. We propose here an alternative approach that moves the computational burden to a learning stage. Given a single example of a texture, our approach trains compact feed-forward convolutional networks to generate multiple samples of the same texture of arbitrary size and to transfer artistic style from a given image to any other image. The resulting networks are remarkably light-weight and can generate textures of quality comparable to Gatys{\~{}}et{\~{}}al., but hundreds of times faster. More generally, our approach highlights the power and flexibility of generative feed-forward models trained with complex and expressive loss functions.},

abstract = {Although many studies have demonstrated that average faces tend to be attractive, few studies have examined the extent to which symmetry contributes to the attractiveness of average faces. Such studies are potentially important, however, because average faces are highly symmetric and increasing the symmetry of face images increases their attractiveness. Here we demonstrate that increasing averageness of 2-D face shape independently of symmetry is sufficient to increase attractiveness, indicating that preferences for symmetry cannot solely explain the attractiveness of average faces. Additionally, we show that averageness preferences are significantly weaker when the effects of symmetry are controlled for using computer graphic methods than when the effects of symmetry are not controlled for, suggesting that symmetry contributes to the attractiveness of average faces. Importantly, this latter finding was not explained by the greater perceived similarity between versions offaces that varied in averageness, but not symmetry, than between versions of faces that varied in both averageness and symmetry.},

Children studied 10 pictures, predicted how many they would recall, and then attempted to recall them. This study-prediction-recall trial was repeated multiple times with new pictures on each trial. In Experiment 1, children were overconfident on the initial trial, and this overconfidence persisted across three trials. In Experiment 2, children predicted either their own performance or another child's performance. Their predictions were overconfident across all trials regardless of whether they made predictions for themselves or for another child, suggesting that wishful thinking cannot fully account for their overconfidence. In Experiment 3, some children postdicted their previous recall performance prior to making each prediction. Although their postdictions were quite accurate, their predictions were still overconfident across five trials. Preschoolers' overconfidence was remarkably resistant to the repeated experience of recalling fewer pictures than the children had predicted. Even asking them to report the number that they recalled on a previous trial, which they could do accurately, did not cause them to lower their predictions across trials.},

Psychometric properties of the newly developed Meta-Emotion Scale (MES) are presented. Psychological well-being is strongly predicted by all three facets. Of the six MES subscales, substantial predictive power could be confirmed for "contempt/shame", "suppression", "tough control" and "interest", whereas "anger" and "compassionate care", unexpectedly, exerted little influence in our non-clinical sample.

Creativity tests can be divided along lines concentrating on biographical and personal properties. In the case of school children, creativity tests are most useful as indicators of potential, since few children produce widely acclaimed creative products. Although a variety of creativity tests exists, their ability to measure real life creativity in a reliable way is open to doubt. This may well be because creativity involves a combination of psychological elements, some of them apparently contradictory or paradoxical, in both cognitive and noncognitive domains. The author suggests that measurement of creativity probably requires new procedures that cross conventional test boundaries. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

abstract = {Research on political judgment and decision-making has converged with decades of research in clinical and social psychology suggesting the ubiquity of emotion-biased motivated reasoning. Motivated reasoning is a form of implicit emotion regulation in which the brain converges on judgments that minimize negative and maximize positive affect states associated with threat to or attainment of motives. To what extent motivated reasoning engages neural circuits involved in "cold" reasoning and conscious emotion regulation (e.g., suppression) is, however, unknown. We used functional neuroimaging to study the neural responses of 30 committed partisans during the U.S. Presidential election of 2004. We presented subjects with reasoning tasks involving judgments about information threatening to their own candidate, the opposing candidate, or neutral control targets. Motivated reasoning was associated with activations of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, insular cortex, and lateral orbital cortex. As predicted, motivated reasoning was not associated with neural activity in regions previously linked to cold reasoning tasks and conscious (explicit) emotion regulation. The findings provide the first neuroimaging evidence for phenomena variously described as motivated reasoning, implicit emotion regulation, and psychological defense. They suggest that motivated reasoning is qualitatively distinct from reasoning when people do not have a strong emotional stake in the conclusions reached. {\textcopyright}2006 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.},

abstract = {Disney movies are frequently cited as a source of the what-is-beautiful-is-good stereotype. Two studies (a) assessed prevalence of the stereotype across animated Disney movies; and (b) examined whether exposure to such films influences children's judgments of peers. In Study 1, human characters in 21 films were rated on attractiveness, goodness, and character outcome. Regression analyses demonstrated that attractiveness of a character was a significant predictor of the character's portrayal. In the second study, 42 children (ages 6–12) were exposed to either a high or low beauty-biased film and then rated target peers. Children rated the attractive target more favorably than the less attractive target. However, film exposure did not increase children's use of the stereotype.jasp{\_}676 2687..2709},

abstract = {Subjects performed a rapid feeling-of-knowing task developed by (Reder, L. M., {\&} Ritter, F. (1992). What determines initial feeling of knowing? Familiarity with question terms, not with the answer. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 18, 435-451), while event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded to identify the time course of "feeling-of-knowing" signals. Subjects were shown a series of math problems, some of which were repeated multiple times during the course of the experiment, and subjects had to rapidly decide whether the answer to a given problem could be quickly retrieved from memory (retrieval trials) or had to be calculated on scrap paper (calculate trials). Behavioral results replicated the 1992 study, showing that subjects can estimate whether the answer is known much faster than the answer can be retrieved. ERPs time-locked to the onset of the math problem showed that accurate retrieval trials were associated with greater positivity for an early frontal P2 component (epoched from 180 to 280ms) and a frontal-central P3 component (epoched from 300 to 550ms). Moreover, this feeling-of-knowing signal was not found for subjects who never obtained a successful on-time retrieval. We interpret these findings as suggesting that initial feeling-of-knowing relies on a rapid assessment of the "perceptual fluency" with which the stimulus is processed. If a stimulus is deemed sufficiently familiar, the activation level of an internal problem representation is used to arrive at a decision of whether to search for the answer or to calculate it.},

A total of 158 (112 female) college students from British and American universities took part in this study. Bivariate correlations showed that IB was significantly associated with Openness to Experience, Conscientiousness (negatively), and gf. Hierarchical regression analysis showed personality to be a better predictor of IB than was intelligence. Cognitive ability measures only accounted for 4{\%} of the variance in IB, whereas the Big Five superfactors explained an additional 22{\%} of the variance (with gender explaining a further 3{\%}). Furthermore, selected personality facets of Openness to Experience, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness, explained the largest amount of variance in IB, namely 35{\%}. Results are discussed with regard to the theoretical implications of the taxonomic place of IB in the wider realm of individual differences constructs.},

abstract = {We engineered an interactive music system that influences a user's breathing rate to induce a relaxation response. This system generates ambient music containing periodic shifts in loudness that are determined by the user's own breathing patterns. We evaluated the efficacy of this music intervention for participants who were engaged in an attention-demanding task, and thus explicitly not focusing on their breathing or on listening to the music. We measured breathing patterns in addition to multiple peripheral and cortical indicators of physiological arousal while users experienced three different interaction designs: (1) a "Fixed Tempo" amplitude modulation rate at six beats per minute; (2) a "Personalized Tempo" modulation rate fixed at 75$\backslash${\%} of each individual's breathing rate baseline, and (3) a "Personalized Envelope" design in which the amplitude modulation matches each individual's breathing pattern in real-time. Our results revealed that each interactive music design slowed down breathing rates, with the "Personalized Tempo" design having the largest effect, one that was more significant than the non-personalized design. The physiological arousal indicators (electrodermal activity, heart rate, and slow cortical potentials measured in EEG) showed concomitant reductions, suggesting that slowing users' breathing rates shifted them towards a more calmed state. These results suggest that interactive music incorporating biometric data may have greater effects on physiology than traditional recorded music.},

We interviewed three design researchers selected from a CHI2014 panel on designing for the experiential body. For each designer, we analyzed a publication describing their process of observing movement experience. By analyzing the interviews and publications, we studied how these researchers observe movement and how they articulate it in their design process. From our study, we contribute a set of techniques for performing movement observation inspired by somatics and body-based practices which we define as: attunement, attention, and kinesthetic empathy. We illustrate how these techniques have been applied by the selected researchers, and also highlight the remaining challenges related to articulating, translating, and sharing the felt movement experience in the context of design within HCI. Finally, we address these challenges by arguing for further exploration of movement frameworks from the fields of somatics, body-based practices, and movement studies as specific strategies that can be applied to HCI.},

The authors also review some of the heuristics that people use to make their metacognitive judgments, and methods that have been shown to improve the accuracy of metacognitive judgments.

So to some extent, EFA is actually confirmatory in nature. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) provides a more explicit framework for confirming prior notions about the structure of a domain of content. CFA adds the ability to test constraints on the parameters of the factor model to the methodology of EFA. In practice, people frequently combine EFA and CFA, to the extent that the appropriate statistical model is not actually determinable.

The findings suggest that (a). both male and female observers selectively attend to physically attractive female targets, (b). limiting the attentional capacity of either gender results in biased frequency estimates of attractive females, (c). although females selectively attend to attractive males, limiting females' attentional capacity does not lead to biased estimates of attractive males, (d). observers of both genders exhibit enhanced recognition memory for attractive females but attenuated recognition for attractive males. Results suggest that different mating-related motives may guide the selective processing of attractive men and women.},

abstract = {Purpose The purspose of this study is to examine the interplay between job resources (job control and support for creativity from coworkers and supervisors), age and creativity at work. Job control and support for creativity are assumed to benefit idea creativity and to moderate the relationship between age and idea creativity. Design/methodology/approach A sample of 117 nurses completed questionnaire measures and reported a creative idea they recently had at work. Three subject matter experts rated the creativity of the ideas. Hierarchical regression analyses were used to test hypotheses. Findings Job control and support for creativity as well as age were unrelated to idea creativity. However, job control and support for creativity moderated the relationship between age and idea creativity. Age was positively related to idea creativity under high job control and negatively related to idea creativity under low job control and low support for creativity. Research limitations/implications A potentially selective sample due to systematic drop-outs and a selection effect of older nurses might limit the generalizability of our results. Future research should examine the mechanisms that explain the moderating effect of job resources in the relationship between age and performance. Practical implications Older employees' creativity at work can be raised by fostering support for creativity from coworkers and supervisors. Younger employees should get support to deal with a high level of job control, because their creativity is lowest under a high level of job control. Originality/value Using data from multiple sources the study shows that different constellations of job resources benefit older and younger employees' creativity at work.},

It is undeniably true that people feel increasingly time pressured, particularly in dual- earner households. But much of the time devoted to paid and unpaid tasks is over and above that which is strictly necessary. In that sense, much of the time pressure that people feel is discretionary and of their own making. Using data from the 1992 Australian Time Use Survey, this paper demonstrates that the magnitude of this ‘time-pressure illusion' varies across population groups, being least among lone parents and greatest among the childless and two-earner couples.},

abstract = {We conducted a meta-analysis of research on hindsight bias to gain an up-to-date summary of the overall strength of hindsight effects and to test hypotheses about potential moderators of hindsight distortion.

A total of 95 studies (83 published and 12 unpublished) were included, and 252 independent effect sizes were coded for moderator variables in 3 broad categories involving characteristics of the study, of measurement, and of the experimental manipulation. When excluding missing effect sizes, the overall mean effect size was Md = .39 with a 95{\{}{\%}{\}} confidence interval of .36 to .42. 
Five main findings emerged: 
(a) effect sizes calculated from objective probability estimates were larger than effect sizes calculated from subjective probability estimates;

(b) effect sizes of studies that used almanac questions were larger than effect sizes of studies that used real-world events or case histories; 
(c) studies that included neutral outcomes resulted in larger effect sizes than studies that used positive or negative outcomes; 
(d) studies that included manipulations to increase hindsight bias resulted in significantly larger effect sizes than studies in which there were no manipulations to reduce or increase hindsight bias; and 
(e) studies that included manipulations to reduce hindsight bias did not produce lower effect sizes. 
These findings contribute to our understanding of hindsight bias by updating the state of knowledge, widening the range of known moderator variables, identifying factors that may activate different mediating processes, and highlighting critical gaps in the research literature.},

abstract = {Productivity research has focused on simple jobs with the individual as the unit of analysis. Most jobs are more complex and, because of the interdependencies in the work, require group-level interventions and more complex measures of performance or productivity. This research presents a new method of measuring productivity, the Productivity Measurement and Enhancement System (ProMES), and uses measures from this approach as a foundation for group-based feedback, goal setting, and incentives. The experimental design consisted of a baseline period of 8 to 9 months, followed by a 5-month period of feedback based on the ProMES. Goal setting was then added to feedback for 5 months. Finally, incentives in the form of time off from work were added to feedback and goal setting for another 5 months. Results indicated that group-level feedback increased productivity an average of 50{\{}{\%}{\}} over baseline, group goal setting increased productivity 75{\{}{\%}{\}} over baseline, and group incentives increased productivity 76{\{}{\%}{\}} over baseline. Control group data showed no or only a slight increase in productivity over the same period, and level of personnel either stayed the same or decreased. In addition, work attitudes such as job satisfaction, turnover intentions, and morale were as good or better following the interventions.

annote = {a{\{}{\_}{\}}feedback
Feedback. Productivity feedback consisted of formal computer-generated
reports that were given monthly to the personnel in each unit. To
develop these reports we first produced examples of what the basic report
would look like and asked supervision how best to present the material
for maximum clarity. We also proposed some other information
that they might find useful and asked them for their suggestions on
things to be included. This was discussed, and after several revisions, a
final version of the productivity feedback report was developed
The first part of the resulting report was the basic productivity data.
It showed the products and indicators, the indicator data for that month,
the effectiveness score associated with that level of each indicator, and
overall effectiveness for the unit. The report also included the indicator
data and effectiveness scores for both the previous month and the current
month, and the changes in effectiveness from the last month to the
current month. This part of the report was requested by unit personnel
to aid them in diagnosing areas where they were increasing or decreasing
in productivity.
Another feature of the report was information comparing the productivity
of different units

The feedback report was generated each month for each of the five
units. It was presented within 3 working days after the end of the month
and was given to the chain of command from section supervision to
upper-level management. It was also posted in the working area of each
section so incumbents could review it

Disposition theory proposes that appeal is a function of the dispositions viewers hold towards characters, which are in turn driven by viewer perceptions of character morality and outcomes experienced by characters. However, the manner in which dispositions change overtime has not been extensively researched. In addition, disposition research has overlooked characters that do not provoke consistently strong dispositions in viewers. The current study tracks disposition formation across eight weeks of a serial drama. Results indicate that as predicted, character morality and liking are strongly related, and that depending on the morality of the character, these dispositions can shift overtime in a predictable fashion. Characters who do not engender strong dispositions in viewers do play a role in overall enjoyment, however may be less critical in dispositional processes than clearcut heroes and villains. Therefore, to understand the role these characters play we may need to look beyond dispositional concerns.},

abstract = {For industrial and organizational psychologists who are unfamiliar with the mindfulness literature, Hyland, Lee, and Mills (2015) nicely introduce the concept by highlighting key findings from prior studies. Although their review focuses on the many benefits of mindfulness, we believe that mindfulness research should address certain questions that will help us understand whether mindfulness interventions result in a cost-effective positive return on investment. In alignment with the perspective of evidence-based practice (Briner {\&} Rousseau, 2011; Pfeffer {\&} Sutton, 2006), we call for a holistic evaluation of mindfulness, including a consideration of when or how unintended side effects emerge. Importantly, we discuss the potential mechanisms by which mindfulness generates valued outcomes (e.g., performance and collective psychological climate) and the need for more sophisticated research to isolate these causal effects. We also consider how the judicious use of utility analytics (e.g., cost effectiveness and return on investment) might help demonstrate the value of mindfulness interventions while also acknowledging questions of causality that must be addressed for such value to be experienced. We close by clarifying that we have the intention of promoting research to further evidence-based practices. There are organizations that have already begun providing mindfulness meditation interventions, and it is our hope that our commentary will help practitioners in these settings to consider the evidence suggesting that there may be unknown nuances regarding mindfulness practice. Ultimately, we believe that mindfulness is an important burgeoning area of research deserving of more scholarly attention.},

abstract = {The ways in which a person's values, beliefs, emotional states, and behavior preferences can influence the perception of others is one of the most actively researched areas in the psychology of the self. And yet, no volume thus far has integrated this diverse study into a single presentation that distinguishes common issues and concerns. The chapters in this volume, written by leading researchers in the field, identify and elucidate four critical themes involved in the self in social judgment: the self as a referential source or basis for evaluating others, often referred to as 'social projection' the assumed superiority of the self, or self-bias, as reflected in the pervasive tendency to view personal characteristics more favorably than those found in others; the self as a comparison standard against which the behaviors and attributes of others are assimilated or contrasted; and finally, the relative weight placed on the individual and collective selves in defining one's own attributes, when comparing them to those of others. This volume begins with a historical overview of the self in social judgment, and outlines the major themes discussed. In conclusion, a chapter summary reviews the various approaches and identifies important avenues for future research.},

But attempts to use participatory design - in technical communication and elsewhere - have been hampered because participatory design has typically been seen as an orientation or field rather than a methodology with its own methods, techniques, and acceptable range of research designs. In this article, I work with a range of participatory design sources to describe it as a methodology useful for technical communicators. After providing the historical and methodological grounding for understanding participatory design as a methodology, I describe its research designs, methods, criteria, and limitations.

abstract = {Evaluating metamnemonic accuracy is an inherently difficult enterprise as the theorist must contend with all of the usual variability inherent to normal memory behavior and additionally consider other sources that are relevant only to the metamnemonic aspects of the task. This chapter reviews the arguments motivating the use of the Goodman-Kruskal gamma coefficient y in assessing metamnemonic accuracy and pits that statistic against a distance-based metric d{\textless}xh:sub{\textgreater}a{\textless}/xh:sub{\textgreater}derived from signal detection theory (Green {\&} Swets, 1966). We evaluate the question of which potential measures of metamnemonic accuracy have the most desirable measurement characteristics and which measures support the types of inference that researchers commonly wish to draw. In doing so, we attempt to make general arguments without providing a detailed account of the underlying mathematics or statistics, but we do place appropriate references should those interested desire a more technical treatment of the issues that arise. T. O. Nelson was a pioneer of methodologies in the field and a consistent devotee of increasing analytical sophistication and rigorous measurement (see, e.g., Gonzalez {\&} Nelson, 1996; Nelson, 1984). Although not all of the conclusions reached in this chapter are the same as those reached in Nelson's (1984) classic article, we would hope that the work nonetheless is considered a testament to Nelson's legacy of meticulous attention to the quantitative foundations of metacognitive research.

abstract = {Although both individual and average causal effects are defined in Rubin's approach to causality, in this tradition almost all papers center around learning about the average causal effects. Almost no efforts deal with developing designs and models to learn about individual effects. This paper takes a first step in this direction. In the first and general part, Rubin's concepts of individual and average causal effects are extended replacing Rubin's deterministic potential-outcome variables by the stochastic expected-outcome variables. Based on this extension, in the second and main part specific designs, assumptions and models are introduced which allow identification of (1) the variance of the individual causal effects, (2) the regression of the individual causal effects on the true scores of the pretests, (3) the regression of the individual causal effects on other explanatory variables, and (4) the individual causal effects themselves. Although random assignment of the observational unit to one of the treatment conditions is useful and yields stronger results, much can be achieved with a nonequivalent control group. The simplest design requires two pretests measuring a pretest latent trait that can be interpreted as the expected outcome under control, and two posttests measuring a posttest latent trait: The expected outcome under treatment. The difference between these two latent trait variables is the individual-causal-effect variable, provided some assumptions can be made. These assumptions - which rule out alternative explanations in the Campbellian tradition - imply a single-trait model (a one-factor model) for the untreated control condition in which no treatment takes place, except for change due to measurement error. These assumptions define a testable model. More complex designs and models require four occasions of measurement, two pretest occasions and two posttest occasions. The no-change model for the untreated control condition is then a single-trait-multistate model allowing for measurement error and occasion-specific effects.},

To validate the TAM, 79 teenagers took part in an outdoor event that aimed to foster creativity through the use of a mobile phone. Different features of the mobile phone were used by the teenagers to conduct interviews, communicate with peers, and orient themselves using the GPS, among other applications. The proposed TAM yielded successful results since a Principal Components Analysis (PCA) revealed that the constructs Perceived Usefulness, Perceived Ease of Use and Perceived Enjoyment determined Behavioural Intention, exhibiting a high variance of 60.2{\%}. In addition, the explanatory power of the model reached R2 =61{\%}, which is considered strong.},

abstract = {The study of memory is witnessing a spirited clash between proponents of traditional laboratory research and those advocating a more naturalistic approach to the study of "real-life" or "everyday" memory. The debate has generally centered on the "what" (content), "where" (context), and "how" (methods) of memory research. In this target article, we argue that the controversy discloses a further, more fundamental breach between two underlying memory metaphors, each having distinct implications for memory theory and assessment: Whereas traditional memory research has been dominated by the storehouse metaphor, leading to a focus on the number of items remaining in store and accessible to memory, the recent wave of everyday memory research has shifted toward a correspondence metaphor, focusing on the accuracy of memory in representing past events. The correspondence metaphor calls for a research approach that differs from the traditional one in important respects: in emphasizing the intentional-representational function of memory, in addressing the wholistic and graded aspects of memory correspondence, in taking an output-bound assessment perspective, and in allowing more room for the operation of subject-controlled metamemory processes and motivational factors. This analysis can help tie together soine of the what, where, and how aspects of the "real-life/laboratory" controversy. More important, however, by explicating the unique metatheoretical foundation of the accuracy-oriented approach to memory we aim to promote a more effective exploitation of the correspondence metaphor in both naturalistic and laboratory research contexts.},

Specifically, we investigate the extent to which openness, exhibitionism, and competence in interpersonal relationships and flow experience affect the propensity of opinion leadership (OLP) and opinion leadership behavior (OLB). The proposed model was tested with two significant populations in social media, Generation X and Generation Y. The results indicate that openness, exhibitionism, and competence in interpersonal relationships significantly increase OLP. We also find that flow experience (i.e., playfulness and time distortion) strengthens the relationship between OLP and OLB. While the model holds true for both populations, the results show that the role of exhibitionism in OLP is more pronounced for Generation X than Generation Y.},

abstract = {Mismatch negativity (MMN) and N2b were elicited during a selective dichotic-listening task in 16 young (Y), 16 middle-aged (M) and 19 elderly (E) subjects to evaluate automatic and effortful memory comparison of auditory stimuli. Sequences of standard (80{\%}) and deviant (20{\%}) tones were dichotically presented to subjects in two runs. In each run, subjects were instructed to give a button-press response to the deviant (target) tones in the ear designated as attended and to ignore the input to the other ear. Peak latencies, peak amplitudes and mean amplitudes were calculated for MMN and N2b components in each subject. MMN latency and amplitude were quite stable regardless of age, while N2b latency was significantly longer in M and E subjects than in Y subjects. These results are interpreted as reflecting that automatic processes of comparison in auditory memory of stimuli presented at short interstimulus intervals remain quite stable from 23 to 77 years of age; however, those requiring attentional effort decline with age.},

Experiment 1 showed that the level of confidence in the correctness of a recalled answer (CL) is a reliable measure (test-retest G = .87) and a valid predictor of recognition (G = .55/.58). In contrast, the feeling of knowing the correct answer (FOK), although reliable (G = .82), is a poor predictor of recognition (G = .11). In Experiment 2 it was discovered that FOK levels are more highly correlated with beliefs about what should be known than are CL judgments. Controlling for the relationship between FOK and those beliefs eliminates any correlation between FOK and recognition (G drops from .27 to .08), which is not the case with CL (G remains as high as .52). These data suggest that CL is based on the retrieval of at least some elements of the right answer, whereas FOK may be derived from recency or familiarity effects elicited by the question itself.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Empathy plays a key role in social understanding, but its empirical measurement has proved difficult. The Empathy Quotient (EQ) is a self-report scale designed to do just that. This series of four studies examined the reliability and validity of the EQ and determined its factor structure. METHOD: In Study 1, 53 people completed the EQ, Social Desirability Scale (SDS) and a non-verbal mental state inference test, the Eyes Task. In Study 2, a principal components analysis (PCA) was conducted on data from 110 healthy individuals and 62 people reporting depersonalisation (DPD). Approximately 1 year later, Study 3, involved the re-administration of the EQ (n = 24) along with the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI; n = 28). In the last study, the EQ scores of those with DPD, a condition that includes a subjective lack of empathy, were examined in depth. RESULTS: An association was found between the Eyes task and EQ, and only three EQ items correlated with the SDS. PCA revealed three factors: (1) 'cognitive empathy'; (2) 'emotional reactivity', and (3) 'social skills'. Test-retest reliability was good and moderate associations were found between the EQ and IRI subscales, suggesting concurrent validity. People with DPD did not show a global empathy deficit, but reported less social competence. CONCLUSIONS: The EQ is a valid, reliable scale and the different subscales may have clinical applications.},

The literature was organized and discussed according to method used to assess empathy and affective role taking. Where appropriate, meta-analyses were also computed. In general, sex differences in empathy were a function of the methods used to assess empathy. There was a large sex difference favoring women when the measure of empathy was self-report scales; moderate differences (favoring females) were found for reflexive crying and self-report measures in laboratory situations; and no sex differences were evident when the measure of empathy was either physiological or unobtrusive observations of nonverbal reactions to another's emotional state. Moreover, few sex differences were found for children's affective role taking and decoding abilities. Several possible explanations for the pattern of findings are discussed.},

abstract = {Because of the way in which data are typically analyzed and interpreted, they frequently lie to researchers, leading to conclusions that are not only false but more complex than the underlying reality. The several examples of this presented in this article illustrate the possibility that although data may appear to indicate complex phenomena at the surface structure level, the phenomena may be quite simple at the deep structure level, suggesting the possibility of applying Occam's razor to achieve the scientific goal of parsimony. The approaches to data analysis described in this article may also lead to a solution to the serious problem of construct proliferation in psychology by demonstrating that many constructs are redundant with other existing constructs. The major obstacles to these outcomes are researchers' continued reliance on the use of statistical significance testing in data analysis and interpretation and the failure to correct for the distorting effects of sampling error, measurement error, and other artifacts. Some of these problems have been addressed by the now widespread use of meta-analysis, but examination of the meta-analyses appearing in Psychological Bulletin from 1978 to 2006 shows that most employ a statistically inappropriate model for meta-analysis (the fixed effects model) and that 90{\%} do not correct for the biasing effects of measurement error. Hence, there is still a long way to go in the improvement of data analysis and interpretation methods.},

abstract = {The experiments address the degree to which retrieval fluency--the case with which information is accessed from long-term memory--guides and occasionally misleads metamnemonic judgments. In each of 3 experiments, participants' predictions of their own future recall performance were examined under conditions in which probability or speed of retrieval at one time or on one task is known to be negatively related to retrieval probability on a later task. Participants' predictions reflected retrieval fluency on the initial task in each case, which led to striking mismatches between their predicted and actual performance on the later tasks. The results suggest that retrieval fluency is a potent but not necessarily reliable source of information for metacognitive judgments. Aspects of the results suggest that a basis on which better and poorer rememberers differ is the degree to which certain memory dynamics are understood, such as the fleeting nature of recency effects and the consequences of an initial retrieval. The results have pedagogical as well as theoretical implications, particularly with respect to the education of subjective assessments of ongoing learning.},

This study examined the frequency of mobile phone dependence in Chinese university students and explored its association with social support and impulsivity. Altogether, 909 university students were consecutively recruited from a large university in China. Mobile phone use, mobile phone dependence, impulsivity, and social support were measured with standardized instruments. The frequency of possible mobile phone use and mobile phone dependence was 78.3{\%} and 7.4{\%}, respectively. Multinomial logistic regression analyses revealed that compared with no mobile phone dependence, possible mobile phone dependence was significantly associated with being male (p = 0.04, OR = 0.7, 95{\%} CI: 0.4–0.98), excessive mobile phone use (p {\textless} 0.001, OR = 1.2, 95{\%} CI: 1.09–1.2), and impulsivity (p {\textless} 0.001, OR = 1.05, 95{\%} CI: 1.03–1.06), while mobile phone dependence was associated with length of weekly phone use (p = 0.01, OR = 2.5, 95{\%} CI: 1.2–5.0), excessive mobile phone use (p {\textless} 0.001, OR = 1.3, 95{\%} CI: 1.2–1.4), and impulsivity (p {\textless} 0.001, OR = 1.08, 95{\%} CI: 1.05–1.1).

A framework for positive design is introduced that includes three main components of subjective well-being: pleasure, personal significance and virtue. Each component represents an ingredient of design for happiness, and we propose that design that expressly includes all three ingredients is design that promotes human flourishing. People who flourish are developing as individuals, live their lives to their fullest potential, and act in the best interests of society. The intention to support human flourishing is the explicit, central design objective of positive design. Five characteristics of positive design are proposed, all of which are of relevance to organizing design processes that intend to result in designs that stimulate human flourishing. In addition, some contemporary design approaches are discussed that focus on quality of life, including nudge, capability approach, and experience design. Four important research challenges are outlined to indicate directions for a research agenda. Together with the framework, these research directions are intended to offer inspiration for designers and design researchers to join forces in their endeavours to design for subjective well-being.},

Results for the total sample indicate a strong relation between neuroticism and SWB, and an important influence of reconstructed life events on SWB with a stronger effect for negative as compared to positive events. Age differences in the prediction of SWB emerge for personality and life events: extraversion is only a predictor of SWB in young adults and the effect of neuroticism is more pronounced in old adults. Moreover, the influence of negative life events on SWB is stronger in young and middle-aged adults as compared to old adults. These results emphasize the need to study dispositional and situational variables across the life span in order to better understand the underlying mechanisms of SWB. {\textcopyright}2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {In the last 10–15 years, the embodied and grounded (E and G) cognition approach has become widespread in all fields related to cognitive (neuro) science, and a lot of evidence has been collected. The approach proposes that cognitive activity is grounded in sensory–motor processes and situated in specific contexts and situations. This special topic had two aims: first, give an idea of the field in its broadness. Second, focus on some challenges for E and G theories. The first important challenge is to account for understanding abstract con- cepts and words. Evidence on the represen- tation of concrete concepts is compelling, whereas evidence on abstract concepts is still scarce and limited to restricted domains. A second important challenge concerns the role of computational models. E and G theories of cognition need to formulate more precise hypotheses, and models help to constrain and specify in more detail the predictions and the claims advanced.},

@article{Mairesse2007,
abstract = {It is well known that utterances convey a great deal of information about the speaker in addition to their semantic content. One such type of information consists of cues to the speaker's personality traits, the most fundamental dimension of variation between humans. Recent work explores the automatic detection of other types of pragmatic variation in text and conversation, such as emotion, deception, speaker charisma, dominance, point of view, subjectivity, opinion and sentiment. Personality affects these other aspects of linguistic production, and thus personality recognition may be useful for these tasks, in addition to many other potential applications. However, to date, there is little work on the automatic recognition of personality traits. This article reports experimental results for recognition of all Big Five personality traits, in both conversation and text, utilising both self and observer ratings of personality. While other work reports classification results, we experiment with classification, regression and ranking models. For each model, we analyse the effect of different feature sets on accuracy. Results show that for some traits, any type of statistical model performs significantly better than the baseline, but ranking models perform best overall. We also present an experiment suggesting that ranking models are more accurate than multi-class classifiers for modelling personality. In addition, recognition models trained on observed personality perform better than models trained using self-reports, and the optimal feature set depends on the personality trait. A qualitative analysis of the learned models confirms previous findings linking language and personality, while revealing many new linguistic markers. {\textcopyright}2007 AI Access Foundation.

@article{Roberts2011,
abstract = {Growing effort is being made to understand how different attractive physical traits co-vary within individuals, partly because this might indicate an underlying index of genetic quality. In humans, attention has focused on potential markers of quality such as facial attractiveness, axillary odor quality, the second-to-fourth digit (2D:4D) ratio and body mass index (BMI). Here we extend this approach to include visually-assessed kinesic cues (nonverbal behavior linked to movement) which are statistically independent of structural physical traits. The utility of such kinesic cues in mate assessment is controversial, particularly during everyday conversational contexts, as they could be unreliable and susceptible to deception. However, we show here that the attractiveness of nonverbal behavior, in 20 male participants, is predicted by perceived quality of their axillary body odor. This finding indicates covariation between two desirable traits in different sensory modalities. Depending on two different rating contexts (either a simple attractiveness rating or a rating for long-term partners by 10 female raters not using hormonal contraception), we also found significant relationships between perceived attractiveness of nonverbal behavior and BMI, and between axillary odor ratings and 2D:4D ratio. Axillary odor pleasantness was the single attribute that consistently predicted attractiveness of nonverbal behavior. Our results demonstrate that nonverbal kinesic cues could reliably reveal mate quality, at least in males, and could corroborate and contribute to mate assessment based on other physical traits.},

abstract = {This correction focuses on issues surrounding definitions of creativity. The overarching purpose of all corrections is to remind researchers that the field of creativity studies predates online literature searches. Although the science of creativity is, in some ways, unique and unlike other scientific endeavors, the field of creativity studies relies on the scientific method and is implicitly collaborative. Creativity requires both originality and effectiveness. Originality is vital for creativity but is not sufficient. Ideas and products that are merely original might very well be useless. Effectiveness may take the form of value. This label is quite clear in the economic research on creativity; it describes how original and valuable products and ideas depend on the current market, and more specifically on the costs and benefits of contrarianism. Creativity requires originality and usefulness. This does not imply that no further work is needed and that the standard definition is completely adequate. Important research is being done on several fronts. One involves the basis of judgments. The standard definition only pinpoints which criteria must be used; it does not say anything about who is to judge each, and who is to judge the judges.

abstract = {The technological progress of the last decades, especially in the computational technology, allowed the storage and fast analysis of a continuously increasing number of datasets. This development is widely omnipresent leading to a situ-ation where the job of a data scientist is " the sexiest job of the 21st century " (Harvard Business Review). However, well-qualified data scientist are not a dime a dozen. Instead, employees being not much familiar with data analysis are often called to do the job. Automatic machine learning can help those persons to perform predictive model-ing with high performing machine learning tools without having much experience. This is achieved by making those applications parameter-free, i.e. only the data is required as input. The rest is done automatically. Projects like Auto-WEKA or auto-sklearn aim to solve the Combined Algorithm Selection and Hyperpa-rameter optimization (CASH) problem resulting in a huge optimization space. However, for most real world applications, only few different learning algorithms are required to deliver superior performances. autoxgboost simplifies this idea one step further and the CASH problem to taking Gradient Boosting as a single learning algorithm in combination with intelligent model based hyperparameter tuning. It is based on the XGBoost R-Package and also supports categorical variables due to special inbuilt factor feature encoding. After describing the main concepts of gradient boosting and the autoxgboost package, several benchmarks are done to improve the package. This includes multiclass threshold tuning as well as the factor encoding of categorical fea-tures. Thereafter, autoxgboost is compared to Auto-WEKA and auto-sklearn in a benchmark looking on the predictive performance. We find out that even though autoxgboost only uses one learner instead of a whole library, it provides comparable or even better performances on some datasets. However, when limitations of the computational resources are not an issue, auto-sklearn still provides superior performance.},

Results supported this model. Subjective well-being was accounted for by unique genetic influences from Neuroticism, Extraversion, and Conscientiousness, and by a common genetic factor that influenced all five personality domains in the directions of low Neuroticism and high Extraversion, Openness, Agree-ableness, and Conscientiousness. These findings indicate that subjective well-being is linked to personality by common genes and that personality may form an “affective reserve” relevant to set-point maintenance and changes in set point over time.},

For our research, we looked at tweets that focused on the 2016 United States presidential election. Using these tweets, we tried to find a correlation between tweet sentiment and the election results. We wrote a program to collect tweets that mentioned one of the two candidates, then sorted the tweets by state and developed a sentiment algorithm to see which candidate the tweet favored, or if it was neutral. After collecting the data from Twitter and comparing it to the results of the Electoral College, we found that Twitter sentiments corresponded with 66.7{\%} of the actual outcome of the Electoral College. The overall sentiment of all tweets collected leaned more positively towards Donald Trump than it did for Hillary Clinton. Using the data that was collected, we also looked at how different geographical locations affected a candidate's popularity, analyzed what issues were most prevalent in tweets, and looked at the ratio of a state's population versus the number of tweets gathered.

abstract = {Business news carries varied information of different companies. But in this rapidly moving world the number of news sources present is uncountable, and it's humanly impossible to read and find all relevant information in the form of news to draw a conclusion timely to make an investment plan that returns maximum profit. In this paper, we have proposed a predictive model to predict sentiment around stock price. First the relevant real time news headlines and press-releases have been filtered from the large set of business news sources, and then they have been analyzed to predict the sentiment around companies. In order to find correlation between sentiment predicted from news and original stock price and to test efficient market hypothesis, we plot the sentiments of 15 odd companies over a period of 4 weeks. Our result shows an average accuracy score for identifying correct sentiment of around 70.1{\%}. We also have plotted the errors of prediction for different companies which have brought out the RMSE and MAE of 30.3{\%} and 30.04{\%} respectively and an enhanced F1 factor of 78.1{\%}. The comparison between positive sentiment curve and stock price trends reveals 67{\%} co-relation between them, which indicates towards existence of a semi-strong to strong efficient market hypothesis.},

It is argued that developments characterizing mature, i.e., postmodern consumer societies create an atmosphere which supports the rise of compensatory and compulsive buying. These are analyzed in the context of an acculturation process which has been activated by the reunification of East Germany and West Germany back in 1989. Drawing on two national representative surveys investigating compulsive buying which were conducted in Germany in 1991 and 2001, a marked increase in compulsive buying is observed.},

abstract = {An approach to the construction of classifiers from imbalanced datasets is described. A dataset is imbalanced if the classification categories are not approximately equally represented. Often real-world data sets are predominately composed of “normal” examples with only a small percentage of “abnormal” or “interesting” examples. It is also the case that the cost of misclassifying an abnormal (interesting) example as a normal example is often much higher than the cost of the reverse error. Under-sampling of the majority (normal) class has been proposed as a good means of increasing the sensitivity of a classifier to the minority class. This paper shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the minority (abnormal) class and under-sampling the majority (normal) class can achieve better classifier performance (in ROC space) than only under-sampling the majority class. This paper also shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the minority class and under-sampling the majority class can achieve better classifier performance (in ROC space) than varying the loss ratios in Ripper or class priors in Naive Bayes. Our method of over-sampling the minority class involves creating synthetic minority class examples. Experiments are performed using C4.5, Ripper and a Naive Bayes classifier. The method is evaluated using the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC) and the ROC convex hull strategy.},

abstract = {Emotional contagion in online social networks has been of great interest over the past years. Previous studies have focused mainly on finding evidence of affect contagion in homophilic atmospheres. However, these studies have overlooked users' awareness of the sentiments they share and consume online. In this paper, we present an experiment with Twitter users that aims to help them better understand which emotions they experience on this social network. We introduce Tweet Moodifier (T-Moodifier), a Google Chrome extension that enables Twitter users to filter and make explicit (through colored visual marks) the emotional content in their News Feed. We compare behavioral changes between 55 participants and 5089 of their public "friends." The comparison period spans from two weeks before installing T-Moodifier to one week thereafter. The results suggest that the use of T-Moodifier might help Twitter users increase their emotional awareness: T-Moodifier users who had access to emotional statistics about their posts produced a significantly higher percentage of neutral content. This behavioral change suggests that people could behave differently while using real-time mechanisms that increase their affect reflection. Also, post-experience, those who completed both pre- and post-surveys could assert more confidently the main emotions they shared and perceived on Twitter. This shows T-Moodifier's potential to effectively make users reflect on their News Feed.},

abstract = {Experimental measurements show that many relevant processes in telecommunication engineering exhibit self-similarity and long-range dependence (LRD) characteristics. Internet traffic is a significant example. A traditional parameter used to characterize self-similarity and LRD is the Hurst parameter H. Recently, the Modified Allan Variance (MAVAR) has been proposed to estimate the power-law spectrum and thus the Hurst parameter of LRD series. Chaotic generators have been introduced in the last years to mimic time series derived both from sampled Internet or packet video traffic. They are built by means of optimized weighted sums of geometric characteristic sampled from Lorenz strange attractors. The optimization of the structure is obtained observing both the variation coefficients (i.e., a traditional long term feature well matched to the analysis of the error gap processes, related to the Variance-Time plot and to the Hurst parameter too), and, more recently, the logscale diagram. Then, it was quite natural to explore the MAVAR characterization of time series derived from the above chaotic generators, and to compare it to that exhibited by the mimicked process, looking for a fruitful inclusion of MAVAR terms in the optimization cost function. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.},

However, typically, the materials were short, and participants had ample time for study. In contrast, in Experiment 1, when participants had insufficient time to study, they allocated more time to the judged-easy items than to the judged-difficult items, especially when expecting a test. In Experiment 2, when the materials were shorter, people allocated more study time to the judged-difficult materials. In Experiment 3, under high time pressure, people preferred studying judged-easy sonnets; under moderate time pressure, they showed no preference. These results provide new evidence against extant theories of study-time allocation.},

Study 2 shows that college-age men find female figures with low WHR more attractive, healthier, and of greater reproductive value than figures with a higher WHR. In Study 3, 25- to 85-year-old men were found to prefer female figures with lower WHR and assign them higher ratings of attractiveness and reproductive potential.

abstract = {The Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS) was developed to assess satisfaction with the respondent's life as a whole. The scale does not assess satisfaction with life domains such as health or finances but allows Ss to integrate and weight these domains in whatever way they choose. Normative data are presented for the scale, which shows good convergent validity with other scales and with other types of assessments of subjective well-being. Life satisfaction as assessed by the SWLS shows a degree of temporal stability (e.g., .54 for 4 yrs), yet the SWLS has shown sufficient sensitivity to be potentially valuable to detect change in life satisfaction during the course of clinical intervention. Further, the scale shows discriminant validity from emotional well-being measures. The SWLS is recommended as a complement to scales that focus on psychopathology or emotional well-being because it assesses an individual's conscious evaluative judgment of his or her life by using the person's own criteria.

A clear difference was found with regard to the ideal bust size: 40{\%} of men but only 25{\%} of women preferred a large bust.

Our aim is to integrate the intergroup neuroscience literature with classic theories of group processes and intergroup relations in an effort to move beyond merely describing the effects of specific social out-groups on the brain and behavior. Instead, we emphasize the underlying psychological processes that govern intergroup interactions more generally: forming and updating our representations of “us” and “them” via social identification and functional relations between groups. This approach highlights the dynamic nature of social identity and the context-dependent nature of intergroup relations. We argue that this theoretical integration can help reconcile seemingly discrepant findings in the literature, provide organizational principles for understanding the core elements of intergroup dynamics, and highlight several exciting directions for future research at the interface of intergroup relations and neuroscience.},

abstract = {Human-computer interaction research has produced consistent results bearing on a well-established body of knowledge in cognitive science. In contrast, the new research domains of computer- supported cooperative work (CSCW) or human–machine cooperation are harder to develop because the problems to be solved are more complex and the theoretical frameworks more heterogeneous. However, dynamic situations with high temporal constraints create occasions where small teams (including humans and machines) can cooperate on an almost cognitive basis, reducing social or emotional effects. This paper reviews the state of the art on cognitive cooperation to extend an individual cognitive architecture and deal with these situations, combining private and cooperative activities that are highly task-oriented. Cooperation is taken as the management of interference between individual activities to facilitate the team members' sub-tasks and the team's common task when there is one. This review of the literature is a step towards a theoretical approach that could be relevant to evaluate cooperation and to design assistance in diverse domains such as air traffic control or aircraft piloting.},

Our aim is to integrate the intergroup neuroscience literature with classic theories of group processes and intergroup relations in an effort to move beyond merely describing the effects of specific social out-groups on the brain and behavior. Instead, we emphasize the underlying psychological processes that govern intergroup interactions more generally: forming and updating our representations of “us” and “them” via social identification and functional relations between groups. This approach highlights the dynamic nature of social identity and the context-dependent nature of intergroup relations. We argue that this theoretical integration can help reconcile seemingly discrepant findings in the literature, provide organizational principles for understanding the core elements of intergroup dynamics, and highlight several exciting directions for future research a...},

Examination of a large body of flow literature suggests there is a need for a conceptual model rooted in a cognitive approach to explain how this psychological phenomenon works. In this paper, we propose the Flow Engine Framework, a theoretical model explaining dynamic interactions between rearranged flow components and fundamental cognitive processes. Using an IPO framework (Inputs – Processes – Outputs) including a feedback process, we organize flow characteristics into three logically related categories: inputs (requirements for flow), mediating and moderating cognitive processes (attentional and motivational mechanisms) and outputs (subjective and objective outcomes), describing the process of the flow. Comparing flow with an engine, inputs are depicted as flow-fuel, core processes cylinder strokes and outputs as power created to provide motion.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Impulsivity as a behavioral construct encompasses a wide range of what are often considered maladaptive behaviors. Impulsivity has been assessed using a variety of measures, including both self-report personality questionnaires and behavioral tasks, and each of these measures has been further subdivided into separate components which are thought to represent different underlying processes. However, few studies have employed both personality measures and behavioral tasks, and so the relations among these measures are not well understood. In one analysis we examined correlations between three widely used personality measures (i.e., BIS-11, I7, and MPQ) and four laboratory-task measures of impulsive behavior (behavioral inhibition (2), delay discounting, and risk taking) in 70 healthy adult volunteers. The correlations among the various self-report measures were high, but self-reports were not correlated with behavioral-task measures. In a second analysis we performed a principal-components analysis using data from the four behavioral tasks for 99 participants. Two components emerged, labeled "impulsive disinhibition" (Stop Task and Go/ No-Go task) and "impulsive decision-making" (Delay-Discounting task and Balloon Analog Risk Task). Taken collectively, these analyses support other recent findings indicating that self-report and behavioral tasks probably measure different constructs, and suggest that even among the behavioral measures, different tasks measure different, perhaps unrelated, components of impulsive behavior. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Evidence suggests that mind wandering shares many similarities with traditional notions of executive control. When mind wandering occurs, the executive components of attention appear to shift away from the primary task, leading to failures in task performance and superficial representations of the external environment. One challenge for incorporating mind wandering into standard executive models is that it often occurs in the absence of explicit intention--a hallmark of controlled processing. However, mind wandering, like other goal-related processes, can be engaged without explicit awareness; thus, mind wandering can be seen as a goal-driven process, albeit one that is not directed toward the primary task.},

Participants (N = 128) rated female breast attractiveness as a function of size (five levels) and viewing angles (front view, oblique view, and side view). Men were divided into two groups (restricted and unrestricted), based on their responses to the Revised Sociosexual Orientation Inventory (SOI-R). As predicted, men with higher SOI-R scores (unrestricted) generally gave higher ratings than did men who scored lower on the SOI-R (restricted), but the difference was significant only at larger breast sizes. We also found that medium to large sizes were rated as the most attractive by both male groups and that viewing angle changed rating of female attractiveness and breast presented in oblique view were rated generally higher than in side view. The results of the study indicate that sociosexuality influences male perception of female breast attractiveness and confirm that accentuation of female-specific physical traits produces a stronger response in unrestricted than in restricted men.},

The degree of interference is determined by the degree of effortfulness of the task, the severity of depression, and the valence of the stimulus material to be processed. (b) Depression interferes only minimally with automatic processes. Hypothetical causal mechanisms for interference in effortful processes by depression, whether interference in effortful processing is unique to depression or characteristic of psychopathology in general, and whether negative automatic thoughts are associated with current depression or depression proneness are also addressed. The effortful-automatic perspective has implications for understanding depressive clinical features, treating depression, and conducting future research.},

Compared with quiet rest and non-REM sleep, REM enhanced the formation of associative networks and the integration of unassociated information. Furthermore, these REM sleep benefits were not the result of an improved memory for the primed items. This study shows that compared with quiet rest and non-REM sleep, REM enhances the integration of unassociated information for creative problem solving, a process, we hypothesize, that is facilitated by cholinergic and noradrenergic neuromodulation during REM sleep.},

We do not assume this will happen; instead we relate the design thinking managerial discourse to the discourse of design thinking within the design research area. We observe that the managerial discourse has a surface and popular character and is less academically anchored than the designerly one. Also, the managerial discourse seldom refers to the designerly one and thereby hinders cumulative knowledge construction, and this makes it easy to criticize from an academic perspective. We find five different discourses of “designerly thinking” or ways of making sense of what designers do in practice that have distinctly different epistemological roots. These different discourses do not stand in competition with each other but could be developed in parallel. T4 - The past, present and future of design thinking},

abstract = {Three experiments assessed whether maximizing and satisficing decision-making types were associated with differences in perception of time, as a consequence of their different cognitive workloads. Findings showed that maximizers and satisficers perceived time differently during decision-making, but not during other tasks. In particular, compared to satisficers, maximizers tended to underestimate time while choosing, independently of the number of options and the specific task requirements. Satisficers instead tended to underestimate time only when the number of options or the task requirements were more challenging.

abstract = {Despite the implementation of many teaching and learning approaches, engineering education in higher institution continues to pose challenges to educators. Engineers as a profession, requires both the technical knowledge as well as 'hands-on' experience. Therefore, experiential learning can be very useful to provide the foundation of teaching and learning of engineering. A study has been conducted to explore experiential learning for the Electrical and Electronics Engineering undergraduates from the Faculty of Engineering and Built Environment. These students were participants in a national competition for robotic design competition held annually. Through this new learning approach, the researcher targets to further develop and enhance creativity among the students. This study investigated how construct-based creativity models reflect creative behaviour through experiential-based learning environment. The construct based model used is by Torrance and Safter by measuring students against a list of creativity attributes. This study involvesthree components which provide the framework of the research which are field observations, creativity test and student portfolio assessments. Findings suggest that students' creativity dimensions have been developed and enhanced as a result of the problem solving process involved in the experiential learning activities. This study is beneficial as an indicator for the faculty administrators to plan what is the best and most effective method of delivery for engineering curriculum towards achieving innovation-led nation.},

abstract = {There is disagreement in the literature about the exact nature of the phenomenon of empathy. There are emotional, cognitive, and conditioning views, applying in varying degrees across species. An adequate description of the ultimate and proximate mechanism can integrate these views. Proximately, the perception of an object's state activates the subject's corresponding representations, which in turn activate somatic and autonomic responses. This mechanism supports basic behaviors (e.g., alarm, social facilitation, vicariousness of emotions, mother-infant responsiveness, and the modeling of competitors and predators) that are crucial for the reproductive success of animals living in groups. The Perception-Action Model (PAM), together with an understanding of how representations change with experience, can explain the major empirical effects in the literature (similarity, familiarity, past experience, explicit teaching, and salience). It can also predict a variety of empathy disorders. The interaction between the PAM and prefrontal functioning can also explain different levels of empathy across species and age groups. This view can advance our evolutionary understanding of empathy beyond inclusive fitness and reciprocal altruism and can explain different levels of empathy across individuals, species, stages of development, and situations.},

In this paper we examine whether short-term IBMT can improve performance related to creativity and determine the role that mood may play in such improvement.Methods: Forty Chinese undergraduates were randomly assigned to short-term IBMT group or a relaxation training (RT) control group. Mood and creativity performance were assessed by the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) and Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking (TTCT) questionnaire respectively.Results: As predicted, the results indicated that short-term (30 min per day for 7 days) IBMT improved creativity performance on the divergent thinking task, and yielded better emotional regulation than RT. In addition, cross-lagged analysis indicated that both positive and negative affect may influence creativity in IBMT group (not RT group).Conclusions: Our results suggested that emotion-related creativity-promoting mechanism may be attributed to short-term meditation. {\textcopyright} 2014 Ding et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper explores how the phenomenology of using self- driving cars influences conditions for exercising and ascribing responsibility. First, a working account of responsibility is pre- sented, which identifies two classic Aristotelian conditions for responsibility and adds a relational one, and which makes a distinction between responsibility for (what one does) and responsibility to (others). Then, this account is applied to a phenomenological analysis of what happens when we use a self-driving car and participate in traffic. It is argued that self- driving cars threaten the excercise and ascription of responsi- bility in several ways. These include the replacement of human agency by machine agency, but also the user's changing epis- temic relation to the environment and others, which can be described in terms of (dis)engagement. It is concluded that the discussion about the ethics of self-driving cars and related pro- blems of responsibility should be restricted neither to general responsibilities related to the use of self-driving cars and its objective risks, nor to questions regarding the behavior, intelli- gence, autonomy, and ethical “thinking” of the car in response to the objective features of the traffic situations (e.g. various scenarios). Rather, it should also reflect on the shifting experi- ence of the user: how the new technology reshapes the sub- jectivity of the user and on the morel consequences this has.},

Participants were 147 college students who received a battery of tests of creative potential. Multivariate analyses of variance indicated that ideational fluency scores were significantly associated with several genes (DAT, COMT, DRD4, and TPH1). This was apparent in both verbal and figural flu- ency ideation scores, before and after controlling general intelligence. Yet fluency, alone, is not an adequate measure of creativity, and the index that is by far the most important part of creativity (i.e., originality) had a negligible relationship with the genes under investigation. Hence, in contrast to earlier research, the conclusion offered here is that there is a clear genetic basis for ideational fluency, but that fluency, alone, is not suf- ficient to predict or guarantee creative performance. Hence, at present, the genetic basis of creativity remains uncertain},

abstract = {We now begin our study of reinforcement learning and adaptive control. In supervised learning, we saw algorithms that tried to make their outputs mimic the labels y given in the training set. In that setting, the labels gave an unambiguous "right answer" for each of the inputs x. In contrast, for many sequential decision making and control problems, it is very difficult to provide this type of explicit supervision to a learning algorithm. For example, if we have just built a four-legged robot and are trying to program it to walk, then initially we have no idea what the "correct" actions to take are to make it walk, and so do not know how to provide explicit supervision for a learning algorithm to try to mimic. In the reinforcement learning framework, we will instead provide our algorithms only a reward function, which indicates to the learning agent when it is doing well, and when it is doing poorly. In the four-legged walking example , the reward function might give the robot positive rewards for moving forwards, and negative rewards for either moving backwards or falling over. It will then be the learning algorithm's job to figure out how to choose actions over time so as to obtain large rewards. Reinforcement learning has been successful in applications as diverse as autonomous helicopter flight, robot legged locomotion, cell-phone network routing, marketing strategy selection, factory control, and efficient web-page indexing. Our study of reinforcement learning will begin with a definition of the Markov decision processes (MDP), which provides the formalism in which RL problems are usually posed.},

While researchers have demonstrated the benefits of the presence of customer reviews to an online retailer, a largely uninvestigated issue is what makes customer reviews helpful to a consumer in the process of making a purchase decision. Drawing on the paradigm of search and experience goods from information economics, we develop and test a model of customer review helpfulness. An analysis of 1,587 reviews from Amazon.com across six products indicated that review extremity, review depth, and product type affect the perceived helpfulness of the review. Product type moderates the effect of review extremity on the helpfulness of the review. For experience goods, reviews with extreme ratings are less helpful than reviews with moderate ratings. For both product types, review depth has a positive effect on the helpfulness of the review, but the product type moderates the effect of review depth on the helpfulness of the review. Review depth has a greater positive effect on the helpfulness of the review for search goods than for experience goods. We discuss the implications of our findings for both theory and practice.},

p.134
a) errorneous assumptions may often point to the same (good or bad) alternatives as correct assumptions
b) for complex tasks there is often no single right answer and the available knowledge is insufficient to determine it
c) the best knowledge does not guarantee that action is taken adquately or, even worse, there is the danger of {\{}{\&}{\}}quot;paralysis through analysis{\{}{\&}{\}}quot;.
This last argument leads to the inclusion of another important variable for effective action:
Action capability means the ability to perform complete cycles of decision making and implementation.
Its first main aspect is the decisin capability, which includes the abilities to initiate the tackling of a problem, to advance the problem-solving process, and to make a clear-cut decision.
The second main aspect is the implementation capability, which includes the abilities to guarantee a proper realization and to secure the acceptance of the measures taken.

p.136 
The most important postulates of the model concern the determinants of the growth of knowledge. How is new knowledge produced through interaction?
According to Steiner (1972), the number of the team members has a curvilinear impact on the growth of knowledge because the knowledge potential is too low from very few members, and the process losses become too high with too many members. 
...instead of fruitful controverse discussion, concurrent thinking prevails (see Janis, 1972, on groupthink...). 

p.137
Affective congruence (mutual sympathy or a good group atmosphere) and conative congruence (cooperativeness) are both expected to further a deep, open, and unbiased exchange of ideas and opinions and thereby to support the growth of knowledge). 

That cooperation furthers group effectiveness is well documented in the literature (e.g. D.W. Johnson et al. 1981). But that this happens partly via a larger growth of knowledge and partly via an improved action capability, as the effectiveness model here assumes, has not been previously shown.

We see three implications for improvement: 1. Forced enhancement of everyday objects. 2. Privacy and security threats. 3. Increased friction. We assume that there will be powerful Artificial Intelligence (AI) included in each object, as well as a central intelligent assistant which will be able to communicate between devices, just as devices can communicate between each other. Underlining this assumption we give an introduction to AI. Our hypothesis is that the shape of intelligent objects will adapt, through the inclusion of AI in everyday objects. The basis of our research consists of case studies, following a specifically developed framework. We refine our findings to understand how an object's smartness and shape correlate. We conclude with a confirmation of our hypothesis and define four design goals for intelligent objects.},

abstract = {Processing human affective behavior is important for developing intelligent agents that interact with humans in complex interaction scenarios. A large number of current approaches that address this problem focus on classifying emotion expressions by grouping them into known categories. Such strategies neglect, among other aspects, the impact of the affective responses from an individual on their interaction partner thus ignoring how people empathize towards each other. This is also reflected in the datasets used to train models for affective processing tasks. Most of the recent datasets, in particular, the ones which capture natural interactions ("in-the-wild" datasets), are designed, collected, and annotated based on the recognition of displayed affective reactions, ignoring how these displayed or expressed emotions are perceived. In this paper, we propose a novel dataset composed of dyadic interactions designed, collected and annotated with a focus on measuring the affective impact that eight different stories have on the listener. Each video of the dataset contains around 5 minutes of interaction where a speaker tells a story to a listener. After each interaction, the listener annotated, using a valence scale, how the story impacted their affective state, reflecting how they empathized with the speaker as well as the story. We also propose different evaluation protocols and a baseline that encourages participation in the advancement of the field of artificial empathy and emotion contagion.},

abstract = {The purpose of learning analytics is to optimise learning and the environment in which it occurs. However, while much research has been conducted into how to measure, collect and analyse learner data, little has been conducted into how to aesthetically display information to learners in dashboards and educational materials online to maximise its appeal. This experiment examined the relationship between children's age and their aesthetic preferences towards visual complexity in e-learning web pages designed for them. It applied Berlyne's theory of aesthetic preference: a theory that suggests that people prefer a medium level of stimuli to a low or high level of stimuli. It asked 180 Taiwanese primary school children to indicate their aesthetic preferences towards web pages of high, medium and low visual complexity. The children were divided into three groups: 7-8 year-olds, 9-10 year-olds and 11-12 year-olds. When the ratings of the three age groups were looked at together, they revealed that the children preferred e-learning web pages that had a medium level of visual complexity to those that had a high or low level of visual complexity. As such, the results supported Berlyne's theory. However, when the ratings of the age groups were looked at separately with respect to aesthetic factors, differences were found. In particular, it was found that the 7-8 year-olds preferred e-learning web pages that had a high level of colourfulness while the 9-12 year-olds did not.},

While thinking creatively is an integral part in the daily life of every consumer, surprisingly little research in marketing has examined the factors influencing such processes. In our research, we examine how input and time constraints influence the way in which consumers process information during a creative task and how those processes, in turn, influence the creativity of the solution. Paradoxically, we find that input constraints encourage more creative processing, provided the individual is not under significant time constraints.

abstract = {This paper explores the use of heuristics as cognitive strategies invoked during the process of design. Heuristics are reasoning processes that do not guarantee the best solution, but often lead to potential solutions by providing a simple cognitive “shortcut.”We propose that designers use specific design heuristics to explore the problem space of potential designs, leading to the generation of creative solutions.We test whether design heuristics can be taught to novices, and suggest their use will facilitate the design process at multiple levels of instruction. In the present empirical study, we evaluate a set of six instructional heuristics and validate their effectiveness with product concepts generated by novice designers. Six hundred seventy-three drawings were created by 120 first-year college students under four instructional conditions. Drawings were coded according to their content, use of heuristics, creativity, and practicality. The most creative concepts emerged from the experimental conditions where heuristics were introduced. Heuristics appeared to help the participants “jump” to a new problem space, resulting in more varied designs, and a greater frequency of designs judged as more creative. Our findings suggest that simple demonstration of design heuristics may, at times, be sufficient to stimulate divergent thinking, perhaps because these heuristics are readily grasped and contextual application is not required. Based on these findings, a conceptual model for design education emphasizing the importance of using a variety of heuristics is proposed. This model suggests that learning can be enhanced through exposure to a variety of design heuristics, and can supplement formal education and foster personal development in design learning.},

A principal axis factor analysis of self- and non-self-report SWB measures revealed a single unitary construct underlying the measures. Conventional single-item and multi-item self-report measures correlated highly with alternative measures, with theoretical correlates of SWB, and with a principal axis factor underlying five non-self-report measures of well-being. Comparisons of family versus friend informant reports demonstrated the considerable cross-situational consistency and temporal stability of SWB. Evidence of the discriminant validity of the measures was provided by low correlations of the various SWB measures with constructs theoretically unrelated to well-being. It was concluded that conventional self-report instruments validly measure the SWB construct, and that alternative, non-self-report measures are useful for providing a comprehensive theoretical account of happiness and life satisfaction.},

The low barrier of entry and high data availability of the cryptocurrency market makes it an excellent subject of study, from which it is possible to derive insights into the behavior of markets through the application of sentiment analysis and machine learning techniques for the challenging task of stock market prediction. While there have been some previous studies, most of them have focused exclusively on the behavior of Bitcoin. In this paper, we propose the usage of common machine learning tools and available social media data for predicting the price movement of the Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple and Litecoin cryptocurrency market movements. We compare the utilization of neural networks (NN), support vector machines (SVM) and random forest (RF) while using elements from Twitter and market data as input features. The results show that it is possible to predict cryptocurrency markets using machine learning and sentiment analysis, where Twitter data by itself could be used to predict certain cryptocurrencies and that NN outperform the other models.},

abstract = {A family of scaling corrections aimed to improve the chi-square approximation of goodness-of-fit test statistics in small samples, large models, and nonnormal data was proposed in Satorra and Bentler (1994). For structural equations models, Satorra-Bentler's (SB) scaling corrections are available in standard computer software. Often, however, the interest is not on the overall fit of a model, but on a test of the restrictions that a null model sayM 0 implies on a less restricted oneM 1. IfT 0 andT 1 denote the goodness-of-fit test statistics associated toM 0 andM 1, respectively, then typically the differenceT d =T 0-T 1 is used as a chi-square test statistic with degrees of freedom equal to the difference on the number of independent parameters estimated under the modelsM 0 andM 1. As in the case of the goodness-of-fit test, it is of interest to scale the statisticT d in order to improve its chi-square approximation in realistic, that is, nonasymptotic and nonormal, applications. In a recent paper, Satorra (2000) shows that the difference between two SB scaled test statistics for overall model fit does not yield the correct SB scaled difference test statistic. Satorra developed an expression that permits scaling the difference test statistic, but his formula has some practical limitations, since it requires heavy computations that are not available in standard computer software. The purpose of the present paper is to provide an easy way to compute the scaled difference chi-square statistic from the scaled goodness-of-fit test statistics of modelsM 0 andM 1. A Monte Carlo study is provided to illustrate the performance of the competing statistics.},

This paper focuses on the effects of emotional valence (positive vs negative and approach vs withdrawal) and gender on regional brain activations, with particular emphasis on hypotheses concerning lateralization of brain function in emotion. Overall, we found no support for the hypothesis of overall right-lateralization of emotional function, and limited support for valence-specific lateralization of emotional activity in frontal cortex. In addition, we found that males showed more lateralization of emotional activity, and females showed more brainstem activation in affective paradigms. The study provides evidence that lateralization of emotional activity is more complex and region-specific than predicted by previous theories of emotion and the brain. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

abstract = {Hemispheric asymmetries are a major organizational principle in human emotion processing, but their interaction with prefrontal control processes is not well understood. To this end, we determined whether hemispheric differences in response inhibition depend on the emotional valence of the stimulus being inhibited. Participants completed a lateralised Go/Nogo task, in which Nogo stimuli were neutral or emotional (either positive or negative) images, while Go stimuli were scrambled versions of the same pictures. We recorded the N2 and P3 event-related potential (ERP) components, two common electrophysiological measures of response inhibition processes. Behaviourally, participants were more accurate in withholding responses to emotional than to neutral stimuli. Electrophysiologically, Nogo-P3 responses were greater for emotional than for neutral stimuli, an effect driven primarily by an enhanced response to positive images. Hemispheric asymmetries were also observed, with greater Nogo-P3 following left versus right visual field stimuli. However, the visual field effect did not interact with emotion. We therefore find no evidence that emotion-related asymmetries affect response inhibition processes.},

abstract = {This article examines the philosophical position of pragmatism as a conceptual scaffold for design thinking. A number of existing contributions to design have drawn upon concepts from pragmatism. The article continues this line of thought by a wider examination of how central concepts in design thinking resonate with the pragmatist philosophy of John Dewey. The argument put forward here is that there is a large degree of convergence between the pragmatist perspective and design thinking. Pragmatism offers well-developed and coherent articulations of concerns that are central to design thinking and the pragmatist perspective can be of value on both a theoretical and practical level. On a theoretical level, it can inform and inspire the development of the discourse on design. On a practical level, pragmatist concepts can be operationalized to inform and guide concrete design projects and help us understand and orchestrate the design process. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

For example, one image could be that of a painting or a sketch while the other is a photo of a real scene, and both depict the same type of scene. Our technique finds semantically-meaningful dense correspondences between two input images. To accomplish this, it adapts the notion of "image analogy" with features extracted from a Deep Convolutional Neutral Network for matching; we call our technique Deep Image Analogy. A coarse-to-fine strategy is used to compute the nearest-neighbor field for generating the results. We validate the effectiveness of our proposed method in a variety of cases, including style/texture transfer, color/style swap, sketch/painting to photo, and time lapse.},

However, research among sociologists, psychologists, or psychiatrists has not formally identified addictive use of the Internet as a problematic behavior. This study investigated the existence of Internet addiction and the extent of problems caused by such potential misuse. Of all the diagnoses referenced in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—Fourth Edition (DSM-IV; American Psychiatric Association, 1995), Pathological Gambling was viewed as most akin to the pathological nature of Internet use. By using Pathological Gambling as a model, addictive Internet use can be defined as an impulse-control disorder that does not involve an intoxicant. Therefore, this study developed a brief eight-item questionnaire referred to as a Diagnostic Questionnaire (DQ), which modified criteria for pathological gambling to provide a screening instrument for classification of participants. On the basis of this criteria, case studies of 396 dependent Internet users (Dependents) and 100 nondependent Internet users (Nondependents) were classified. Qualitative analyses suggest significant behavioral and functional usage differences between the two groups such as the types of applications utilized, the degree of difficulty controlling weekly usage, and the severity of problems noted. Clinical and social implications of pathological Internet use and future directions for research are discussed.},

Separate meta-analyses were initially conducted for results of studies using measures of general IQ, performance IQ, and verbal IQ for studies using samples of adults, children, and the mentally retarded. They were first conducted on the published (uncorrected) correlations. Following this, the resultant values were corrected for the extraneous effects of the artifacts (viz., sampling error, error of measurement, and range variation) and the meta-analyses were repeated. Results of these meta-analyses indicate that IT is related (negatively) to IQ, at least with measures of general IQ and performance IQ. For adults, with general measures of IQ, this correlation is about -.54, after correction for the effects of artifactual sources of error (-.30 prior to correction). IT, however, also appears to measure other factors besides g, possibly perceptual organization, which is reflected in the higher relationship of IT to performance measures of IQ. Finally, the theory that IT is ontogenetically related to IQ does not receive support. Rather, results of this study suggest that the degree of the IT-IQ relationship is relatively constant across age, at least through the range of ages tested in the literature. {\textcopyright}1989 Ablex Publishing Corporation.},

abstract = {Understanding users' whole-body gesture performance quantitatively requires numerical gesture descriptors or features. However, the vast majority of gesture features that have been proposed in the literature were specifically designed for machines to recognize gestures accurately, which makes those features exclusively machine-readable. The complexity of such features makes it difficult for user interface designers, non-experts in machine learning, to understand and use them effectively (see, for instance, the Hu mo-ment statistics or the Histogram of Gradients features), which reduces considerably designers' available options to describe users' whole-body gesture performance with legible and easily interpretable numerical measures. To address this problem, we introduce in this work a set of 17 measures that user interface practitioners can readily employ to characterize users' whole-body gesture performance with human-readable concepts, such as area, volume, or quantity. Our measures describe (1) spatial characteristics of body movement, (2) kinematic performance, and (3) body posture appearance for whole-body gestures. We evaluate our measures on a public dataset composed of 5654 gestures collected from 30 participants, for which we report several gesture findings, e.g., participants performed body gestures in an average volume of space of 1.0 m 3 , with an average amount of hands movement of 14.6 m, and a maximum body posture diffusion of 5.8 m. We show the relationship between our gesture measures and recognition rates delivered by a template-based Nearest-Neighbor whole-body gesture classifier implementing the Dynamic Time Warping dis-similarity function. We also release BOGArT, the Body Gesture Analysis Toolkit, that automatically computes our measures. This work will empower researchers and practitioners with new numerical tools to reach a better understanding of how users perform whole-body gestures and, thus, to use this knowledge to inform improved designs of whole-body gesture user interfaces.},

abstract = {We developed an encompassing theory that explains how readers of fiction and spectators of motion pictures establish affective relationships with fictional characters (FCs). The perceiving and experiencing fictional characters (PEFiC) theory is anchored in art perception, psychological aesthetics, and social and emotion psychology and addresses both the complexity and intrinsic affectivity involved in media exposure. In a between-subject design (N = 312), engagement and appreciation were measured as a function of the ethics (good vs. bad), aesthetics (beautiful vs. ugly), and epistemics (realistic vs. unrealistic) of eight protagonists in feature movies. The PEFiC model best fit the data with a unipolarity of factors and outperformed traditional theories (identification, empathy): The trade-off between involvement and distance explained the appreciation of FCs better than either distance or involvement alone. The mediators similarity, relevance, and valence exerted significant (interaction) effects, thus complicating the results. Furthermore, the effects of mediated bad persons differed strongly from ethically good ones},

It is currently under intense experimental scrutiny. Evidence is converging for the proposition that priming is an expression of a perceptual representation system that operates at a pre-semantic level; it emerges early in development, and access to it lacks the kind of flexibility characteristic of other cognitive memory systems. Conceptual priming, however, seems to be based on the operations of semantic memory.},

The aim of this study was to explore this tension by testing novel, theoretically driven predictions for subjective and objec- tive mental effort and by assessing visual attention control using an experimental research design. Specifically, we predicted that perceived and actual effortful attention might dissociate across 3 conditions of a simulated car-racing task designed to manip- ulate the level of flow: too easy, matched to skill (flow), and too difficult. Task absorption, objective mental effort, and focused gaze were all highest in the matched condition. However, objective performance, reported fluency, and mental effort dem- onstrated a linear relationship across conditions (participants performed worse and reported more effort and less fluency as difficulty increased). These results suggest a dichotomy between objective and reported effort and suggest that flow is underpinned by efficient attentional control},

Statistically based Design of Experiments (DOE) principles were used in developing the guidelines. Four classes of operating variables were considered to characterize the design problem and the environment. The effective- ness metrics proposed are based on outcome and consists of the quantity, quality, novelty, and variety of ideas generated. Two experimental approaches have been developed. In the Direct Method, the influence of the type of design problem and various parameters related to the procedure of an idea generation method is measured by using the method in its entirety. In the Indirect Method, each idea generation method is decomposed into key components and its overall effectiveness is predicted by experimentally studying the ef- fectiveness of its components and their mutual interactions.},

In this research the authors conceptualize and empirically test a model that combines constructs from the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) together along with (1) a moderator between the two models, (2) perceived risk, and (3) trust. The empirical results support the hypothesis that perceived ease of use (from TAM theory) significantly amplifies (positively moderates) the effect of perceived behavioral control (from TPB theory) on intention to use the social networks for transactions. In short, there are benefits to integrating concepts from the two models instead of choosing one model over the other in research and practice. The results also indicate that perceived risk and trust play significant roles as antecedents in consumer decision making, and that risk-taking propensity has a direct effect on behavioral intention.

abstract = {Performance monitoring is an executive function, which we depend on for detecting and evaluating the consequences of our behavior. Although event related potentials (ERPs) have revealed the existence of differences after correct and incorrect decisions, it is not known whether there is a trial-by-trial representation of the accuracy of the decision. We recorded the electroencephalographic activity (EEG) while participants performed a perceptual discrimination task, with two levels of difficulty, in which they received immediate feedback. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analyses were used to reveal two components that convey trial-by-trial representations of the correctness of the decisions. Firstly, the performance monitoring-related negativity (PM-N), a negative deflection whose amplitude is higher (more negative) after incorrect trials. Secondly, the performance monitoring-related positivity (PM-P), a positive deflection whose amplitude is higher after incorrect trials. During the time periods corresponding to these components, trials can be accurately categorized as correct or incorrect by looking at the EEG activity; this categorization is more accurate when based on the PM-P. We further show that the difficulty of the discrimination task has a different effect on each component: after easy trials the latency of the PM-N is shorter and the amplitude of the PM-P is higher than after difficult trials. Consistent with previous interpretations of performance-related ERPs, these results suggest a functional differentiation between these components. The PM-N could be related to an automatic error detection system, responsible for fast behavioral corrections of ongoing actions, while the PM-P could reflect the difference between expected and actual outcomes and be related to long-term changes in the decision process. {\textcopyright} 2014 Pardo-Vazquez, Padr{\'{o}}n, Fern{\'{a}}ndez-Rey and Acu{\~{n}}a.},

Several techniques and tools have been developed to support an empathic design process and several issues are indicated that support an empathic process, but precise definitions and a framework of what makes ‘empathy' is missing. Although the need for empathic approaches in design has been repeatedly stressed, a fundamental basis of the concept of empathy is missing. The goal of this paper is to inform the discussion in the design community by applying the concept of empathy as it has developed in psychology. This paper presents a review of how empathy has been discussed in design and psychology literature, and proposes a background framework for supporting empathic approaches in designing. The framework presents empathy in design as a process of four phases, and gives insight into what role the designer's own experience can play when having empathy with the user. This framework can be applied to three areas: research activities, communication activities and ideation activities.},

abstract = {The aim of the article is to demonstrate, discuss and substantiate the embodiment of design thinking: what role does the body play in relation to engaging in design interaction and the generating of ideas? In order to discuss this question, we draw on the phenomenological philosophy of Merleau-Ponty and his concept of the lived body. The phenomenological perspective is related to a single case study in which three designers collaborate during a workshop as they discuss ethnographic video material with the aim of generating new ideas. Through an analysis of their interaction it is argued that the embodied engagement of the designers plays a fundamental role both in understanding the problem at hand and in opening up new ideas leading to a new design solution. The verbal interaction constantly finds its meaning in reference to a tacit level of embodiment, which remains unspoken. The verbal interaction is also integrated into the designer's tacit use of items in the surroundings. Consequently, the paper concludes that design thinking cannot be understood if we are only attentive to verbalised interaction, but design thinking relies on a more complex and multidimensional interaction, which is based on the pre-linguistic engaged perspective of the lived body.},

In this paper we argue that it is methodologically necessary to practice design participation because of the specific nature of design, which is characterised by “wicked problems” and the necessity of employing abductive logic. After reflecting on our findings from the labs for Hong Kong youngsters, we also suggest the concept of intersubjectivity, which is a threefold model of I-It, It-Thou and I-Thou. The I-It relation can be used as an indicator of the existence of an instrumental relationship and the deterioration of the quality of human interaction, whereas the It-Thou relation is an indicator of the formation of an empathic act, which would certainly help open communicative space. The I-Thou relationship engages each member in an entity as a whole and helps accomplish equal dialogues. We propose this threefold typology of intersubjectivity as a conceptual guide for designers to know how to build up communicative space in which equal dialogues are possible and can extend the impact of design participation on social development.},

In the absence of individuating information, participants consistently report more empathy for members of their own assigned group than a competitive out-group. However, individualized descriptions of in-group and out-group targets significantly reduce parochial empathy by interfering with encoding of targets' group membership. Finally, the descriptions that most effectively decrease parochial empathy are those that describe targets' mental states. These results support the role of individuating information in ameliorating parochial empathy, suggest a mechanism for their action, and show that descriptions emphasizing targets' mental states are particularly effective.},

That this is not an idle question is shown by the fact that we spend an enormous amount of time in our lives following stories: telling and listening to them; reading them; watching them on television or in films or on stage. Despite their recurrent similarity and even predictability, we continue to enjoy them. The paper brings to bear on this question two different strands of current literature in experimental psychology: the literature on aesthetic preferences, and the literature on curiosity and interest. The paper discusses how, in the case of storytelling in particular, though also of creative activities in general, there are two types of curiosity at work: explorative curiosity – associated with investigating new ideas for the simple joy of it and regardless of source – and specific curiosity, corresponding to focused exploration and aimed at solving problems for which the accuracy and relevance of information is of importance. In both cases curiosity is felt as an intensely pleasant experience, which is affected not only by external, but also by the internal stimuli of novelty and challenge. But how does interest/curiosity solidify into preferences that have stability enough to guarantee guidance yet sufficient flexibility to allow for change? The answer explored here highlights the distinction between comfort goods and activities and creative goods and activities. The latter, which allow for complexity, variety and multiplicity of dimensions have a transformative power that allows also for sustained stimulation and interest. The broader aim is to analyze the “behavior” of individual preferences – how they form, how they stabilize, how they change – in the consumption not only of art, the usual focus in discussion of aesthetic preferences, but also of all those goods and activities that can be called creative.},

abstract = {Using social media for political analysis is becoming a common practice, espe- cially during election time. Many researchers and media are trying to use social media to understand the public opinion and trend. In this paper, we investigate how we could use Twitter to predict public opinion and thus predict American republican presidential election results. We analyzed millions of tweets from September 2011 leading up to the republican primary elections. First we exam- ine the previous methods regarding predicting election results with social media and then we integrate our understanding of social media and propose a prediction model to predict the public opinions towards Republican Presidential Elections. Our results highlight the feasibility of using social media to predict public opin- ions and thus replace traditional polling. 1},

We also investigated the psychometric properties of several proposed refined versions of the scale. Four sets of analyses are reported. The first analysis confirms the 3-part factor structure of the scale and assesses its reliability. The second analysis identifies those items that do not perform well on the basis of internal, external, and judgmental criteria, and develops three shorter versions of the scale. In the third analysis, the three refined versions of the scale are cross-validated to confirm dimensionality, reliability, and validity. The fourth analysis uses an experiment in an investment decision making context to assess the reliability and nomological validity of the refined scales. These analyses lead us to conclude that a shorter, 6-item Maximization Scale performs best and should be used by future researchers. It is hoped that clarification of the conceptual underpinnings of the maximization construct and development of a refined scale will enhance its use among researchers across several of the social science disciplines.},

Also gender (p=0.001) and the interaction between gender and level of education (p=0.046) had a significant effect over the aesthetic rating. CONCLUSIONS: A lay panel perceived that the aesthetic impact of the visible anterior occlusion was greater in a dental view compared with a full facial view. The anterior visible occlusion, photographed subject, view type are factors, which influence the aesthetic perception of smiles. In addition, gender and level of education had an influence.},

abstract = {In 1950 (at age 27) a sample of 80 male graduate students was assessed on potential, intelligence-intellect, personality and creativity, and then personality and career outcome data were collected again at age 72. Intelligence (primary mental abilities, spatial, and number), intellect, potential, and personality (e.g., self-confidence, tolerance, openness, psychological mindedness, and introversion) at age 27 were expected to covary with creativity at age 27 and predict lifetime creativity at age 72. Yet, due to the non-intellective nature of personality, we predicted that personality would explain unique variance in creativity over and above that already explained by intellect and potential. Results supported each of these expectations. For instance, observer-rated potential and intellect at age 27 predicted lifetime creativity at age 72, and yet personality variables (such as tolerance and psychological mindedness) explained up to 20{\%} of the variance over and above potential and intellect. Rank-order consistency coefficients revealed consistency over 44 years in some traits (e.g., psychological mindedness) and inconsistency in other traits (e.g, dominance). If traits function to lower behavioral thresholds in given situations, then the traits of self-confidence, openness, tolerance, and psychological mindedness (among others) may serve as a relatively direct link to creative behavior. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

How dance has synergistically co-evolved with humans has fueled a rich debate on the function of art and the essence of aesthetic experience, engaging numerous artists, historians, philosophers, and scientists. While dance shares many features with other art forms, one attribute unique to dance is that it is most commonly expressed with the human body. Because of this, social scientists and neuroscientists are turning to dance and dancers to help answer questions of how the brain coordinates the body to perform complex, precise, and beautiful movements. In the present paper, we discuss how recent advances in neuroscientific methods provide the tools to advance our understanding of not only the cerebral phenomena associated with dance learning and observation but also the neural underpinnings of aesthetic appreciation associated with watching dance. We suggest that future work within the fields of dance neuroscience and neuroaesthetics have the potential to provide mutual benefits to both the scientific and artistic communities.},

abstract = {—For more than half a century, emotion re-searchers have attempted to establish the dimensional space that most economically accounts for similarities and differences in emotional experience. Today, many re-searchers focus exclusively on two-dimensional models involving valence and arousal. Adopting a theoretically based approach, we show for three languages that four dimensions are needed to satisfactorily represent similar-ities and differences in the meaning of emotion words. In order of importance, these dimensions are evaluation-pleasantness, potency-control, activation-arousal, and unpredictability. They were identified on the basis of the applicability of 144 features representing the six compo-nents of emotions: (a) appraisals of events, (b) psycho-physiological changes, (c) motor expressions, (d) action tendencies, (e) subjective experiences, and (f) emotion regulation. Reduction of complex data sets involving a large number of measures to a few meaningful underlying dimensions is common in many branches of science. For example, the perception of color is described by the dimensions of brightness, hue, and saturation. For more than half a century, emotion researchers have attempted to establish the underlying dimensional space that most economically accounts for the similarities and differ-ences in emotional experience, and there has been considerable disagreement about the number and nature of the dimensions that provide an optimal framework for studying emotions. Most early research suggested at least three dimensions, commonly evaluation-pleasantness, potency-control, and activation-arousal},

abstract = {Judgments of learning (JOLs) made immediately after items are studied have been shown to be insensitive to the way in which eventual memory performance is affected by (a) imagery versus rote rehearsal and (b) distributed versus massed repetitions. One explanation is that JOLs made immediately after study assess transient information that affects JOLs but is not predictive of eventual memory performance. Accordingly, we hypothesized that if the JOLs are delayed until the transient information about the to-be-judged item has dissapated, they might more accurately assess the effects of the study activities on subsequent retention. Our two experiments confirmed that hypothesis. The magnitude of delayed JOLs was greater after interactive imagery than after rote rehearsal (Experiment 1) and was greater after distributed repetitions than after massed repetitions (Experiment 2). Also, the distributions of JOLs indicated greater confidence (polarization) for delayed JOLs than for immediate JOLs, and the accuracy of predicting item-by-item retention was greater for delayed JOLs than for immediate JOLs in every condition (rote rehearsal, interactive imagery, single presentations, massed repetitions, and distributed repetitions). Thus people's timing of their JOLs is critical for several aspects of metacognition.},

We compare a range of off-the-shelf sentiment analysis tools to manually coded economic news as well as examine the agreement between these dictionary approaches themselves. We assess the performance of five off-the-shelf sentiment analysis tools and two tailor-made dictionary-based approaches. The analyses result in five conclusions. First, there is little overlap between the off-the-shelf tools; causing wide divergence in terms of tone measurement. Second, there is no stronger overlap with manual coding for short texts (i.e., headlines) than for long texts (i.e., full articles). Third, an approach that combines individual dictionaries achieves a comparably good performance. Fourth, precision may increase to acceptable levels at higher levels of granularity. Fifth, performance of dictionary approaches depends more on the number of relevant keywords in the dictionary than on the number of valenced words as such; a small tailor-made lexicon was not inferior to large established dictionaries. Altogether, we conclude that off-the-shelf sentiment analysis tools are mostly unreliable and unsuitable for research purposes–at least in the context of Dutch economic news–and manual validation for the specific language, domain, and genre of the research project at hand is always warranted.},

DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of 62 495 probabilistically linked emergency hospital admissions and death records. SETTING: Three tertiary metropolitan hospitals between July 2000 and June 2003. PARTICIPANTS: All patients 18 years or older whose first ED attendance resulted in hospital admission during the study period. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Deaths on days 2, 7 and 30 were evaluated against an Overcrowding Hazard Scale based on hospital and ED occupancy, after adjusting for age, diagnosis, referral source, urgency and mode of transport to hospital. RESULTS: There was a linear relationship between the Overcrowding Hazard Scale and deaths on Day 7 (r=0.98; 95{\%} CI, 0.79-1.00). An Overcrowding Hazard Scale{\textgreater}2 was associated with an increased Day 2, Day 7 and Day 30 hazard ratio for death of 1.3 (95{\%} CI, 1.1-1.6), 1.3 (95{\%} CI, 1.2-1.5) and 1.2 (95{\%} CI, 1.1-1.3), respectively. Deaths at 30 days associated with an Overcrowding Hazard Scale{\textgreater}2 compared with one of {\textless}3 were undifferentiated with respect to age, diagnosis, urgency, transport mode, referral source or hospital length of stay, but had longer ED durations of stay (risk ratio per hour of ED stay, 1.1; 95{\%} CI, 1.1-1.1; P{\textless}0.001) and longer physician waiting times (risk ratio per hour of ED wait, 1.2; 95{\%} CI, 1.1-1.3; P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Hospital and ED overcrowding is associated with increased mortality. The Overcrowding Hazard Scale may be used to assess the hazard associated with hospital and ED overcrowding. Reducing overcrowding may improve outcomes for patients requiring emergency hospital admission.},

The relationship between impression management and image favorability was then examined across 339 student-student dyads. The results generally suggest that high self-monitors can use impression-management tactics more effectively than can low self-monitors. In particular, high self-monitors appear to be more adept than low self-monitors at using ingratiation, self-promotion, and exemplification to achieve favorable images among their colleagues.},

We introduce the first approach to predict the future popularity of styles discovered from fashion images in an unsupervised manner. Using these styles as a basis, we train a forecasting model to represent their trends over time. The resulting model can hypothesize new mixtures of styles that will become popular in the future, discover style dynamics (trendy vs. classic), and name the key visual attributes that will dominate tomorrow's fashion. We demonstrate our idea applied to three datasets encapsulating 80,000 fashion products sold across six years on Amazon. Results indicate that fashion forecasting benefits greatly from visual analysis, much more than textual or meta-data cues surrounding products.},

Recent research has shown that it is possible to manipulate nonconscious cognition through "priming." Priming is a well-known phenomenon for individual behavior, but we do not know whether priming can be used to influence team behavior. We developed a Web-based computer game that was designed to improve creativity through supraliminal priming, a form of priming in which users are aware of the priming, but not aware of its purpose. Participants were exposed to a priming game and then worked as members of a team to generate ideas on a creativity task. Our results show that when users played the game designed to improve performance, their teams generated significantly more ideas that were of better quality than when they were exposed to neutral priming.},

In two speed-dating studies, romantically unattached individuals completed more than 100 self-report measures about traits and preferences that past researchers have identified as being relevant to mate selection. Each participant met each opposite-sex participant attending a speed-dating event for a 4-min speed date. Random forests models predicted 4{\%} to 18{\%} of actor variance and 7{\%} to 27{\%} of partner variance; crucially, however, they were unable to predict relationship variance using any combination of traits and preferences reported before the dates. These results suggest that compatibility elements of human mating are challenging to predict before two people meet.},

The scales were evaluated in a sample of 689 college students from six locations. The Flourishing Scale is a brief 8-item summary measure of the respondent's self-perceived success in important areas such as relationships, self-esteem, purpose, and optimism. The scale provides a single psychological well-being score. The measure has good psychometric properties, and is strongly associated with other psychological well-being scales. The Scale of Positive and Negative Experience produces a score for positive feelings (6 items), a score for negative feelings (6 items), and the two can be combined to create a balance score. This 12-item brief scale has a number of desirable features compared to earlier measures of positive and negative emotions. In particular, the scale assesses with a few items a broad range of negative and positive experiences and feelings, not just those of a certain type, and is based on the amount of time the feelings were experienced during the past 4 weeks. The scale converges well with measures of emotions and affective well-being.},

In the 1st study, 125 students at a university clinic completed the 3 instruments and measures of anxiety and depression before individual therapy. In the 2nd study, 278 undergraduates completed the 3 instruments at 2 time points 4 weeks apart and completed multiple measures of anxiety and depression at the 2nd time point. Internal consistency alphas were consistently strong for the personal construct measures (.90 to .92) and moderate to strong for the conventional construct measures (.82 to .90). Test-retest reliability coefficients were above .70 for the personal construct and conventional construct measures, but the coefficients for the latter were inflated by the stability of their error terms. The 2 discrepancies were found to be factorially distinct even though they were highly correlated. Convergent and discriminant evidence of validity was found in both studies for all measures except the abstract real-ought discrepancy. Convergence was as strong or stronger for the personal construct measures in comparison to the other measures. Test-criterion evidence of validity, with multiple measures of anxiety and depression as criteria, was found in both studies for all measures except for the abstract real-ought discrepancy in relation to anxiety. Overall, the findings support the idiographic personal construct instrument most strongly for clinical assessment and for clinical, translational, and personality research.},

People whose writing system goes from right to left, in several studies, prefer pictures that face left. We attempted to replicate these findings by testing Bahraini users of Arabic ranging from 2nd grade through 12th grade. Bahraini participants preferred right-facing pictures rather than those that faced in the direction of their writing system, and this preference was somewhat stronger in older students than in younger students. As expected, US fourth graders preferred right-facing pictures. There was no statistically significant difference between them and Bahraini fourth graders. Our results call into question the idea that the directionality of people's primary writing system influences their preferences for pictures. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

This paper challenges that assumption on theoretical and empirical grounds and presents the Noisy Decision Theory of Signal Detection (ND-TSD). Generalized equations for the isosensitivity function and for measures of discrimination that incorporate criterion variability are derived, and the model's relationship with extant models of decision-making in discrimination tasks is examined. An experiment that evaluates recognition memory for ensembles of word stimuli reveals that criterion noise is not trivial in magnitude and contributes substantially to variance in the slope of the isosensitivity function. We discuss how ND-TSD can help explain a number of current and historical puzzles in recognition memory, including the inconsistent relationship between manipulations of learning and the slope of the isosensitivity function, the lack of invariance of the slope with manipulations of bias or payoffs, the effects of aging on the decision- making process in recognition, and the nature of responding in Remember/Know decision tasks. ND- TSD poses novel and theoretically meaningful constraints on theories of recognition and decision- making more generally, and provides a mechanism for rapprochement between theories of decision- making that employ deterministic response rules and those that postulate probabilistic response rules.},

(c) Social and motivational factors, including perceiver self-schemata, social context, and in-group/out-group dynamics, influence social judgment by affecting perceivers' attention to dimensions. Computer simulations show how the model accounts for social influences on exemplar access and use and therefore on the content of social judgments.},

abstract = {Unlike passive humor appreciation, the neural correlates of real-time humor creation have been unexplored. As a case study for creativity, humor generation uniquely affords a reliable assessment of a creative product's quality with a clear and relatively rapid beginning and end, rendering it amenable to neuroimaging that has the potential for reflecting individual differences in expertise. Professional and amateur "improv" comedians and controls viewed New Yorker cartoon drawings while being scanned. For each drawing, they were instructed to generate either a humorous or a mundane caption. Greater comedic experience was associated with decreased activation in the striatum and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), but increased activation in temporal association regions (TMP). Less experienced comedians manifested greater activation of mPFC, reflecting their deliberate search through TMP association space. Professionals, by contrast, tend to reap the fruits of their spontaneous associations with reduced reliance on top-down guided search.},

This position actually houses a number of distinct claims, some of which are more controversial than others. This paper distinguishes and evaluates the following six claims: (1) cognition is situated; (2) cognition is time-pressured; (3) we off-load cognitive work onto the environment; (4) the environment is part of the cognitive system; (5) cognition is for action; (6) off-line cognition is body based. Of these, the first three and the fifth appear to be at least partially true, and their usefulness is best evaluated in terms of the range of their applicability. The fourth claim, I argue, is deeply problematic. The sixth claim has received the least attention in the literature on embodied cognition, but it may in fact be the best documented and most powerful of the six claims.},

abstract = {Deep learning methods have resulted in significant performance improvements in several application domains and as such several software frameworks have been developed to facilitate their implementation. This paper presents a comparative study of five deep learning frameworks, namely Caffe, Neon, TensorFlow, Theano, and Torch, on three aspects: extensibility, hardware utilization, and speed. The study is performed on several types of deep learning architectures and we evaluate the performance of the above frameworks when employed on a single machine for both (multi-threaded) CPU and GPU (Nvidia Titan X) settings. The speed performance metrics used here include the gradient computation time, which is important during the training phase of deep networks, and the forward time, which is important from the deployment perspective of trained networks. For convolutional networks, we also report how each of these frameworks support various convolutional algorithms and their corresponding performance. From our experiments, we observe that Theano and Torch are the most easily extensible frameworks. We observe that Torch is best suited for any deep architecture on CPU, followed by Theano. It also achieves the best performance on the GPU for large convolutional and fully connected networks, followed closely by Neon. Theano achieves the best performance on GPU for training and deployment of LSTM networks. Caffe is the easiest for evaluating the performance of standard deep architectures. Finally, TensorFlow is a very flexible framework, similar to Theano, but its performance is currently not competitive compared to the other studied frameworks.},

Each Ss' data were subjected to an individual factor analysis. Two large factors—Positive and Negative Affect, the major dimensions of mood found in previous research among English-speaking US Ss—emerged in most of the solutions. Japanese/English bilinguals made content sortings of the Japanese terms and 60 English mood words. The resulting 15 bilingual content categories were used in a comparison of Japanese and US mood structures, and a remarkable convergence was revealed. Factor score distributions were also similar in the 2 languages. The major difference between the structures involved the content factor Sleepy, which did not have a significant negative loading on the Japanese Positive Affect factor. This appears to be consistent with known cultural differences in values and behavior.},

However, researchers continue to debate the role of self–other overlap in empathy due to a failure to dissociate neural overlap, subjective resonance, and personal distress. A perception–action view posits that neural-level overlap is necessary during early processing for all social understanding, but need not be conscious or aversive. This neural overlap can subsequently produce a variety of states depending on the context and degree of common experience and emotionality. We outline a framework for understanding the interrelationship between neural and subjective overlap, and among empathic states, through a dynamic-systems view of how information is processed in the brain and body.},

Also, validity only makes sense relative to particular criteria. The criteria strongly associated with DT are detailed in this article. It also summarizes the uses and limitations of DT, conceptually and psychometrically. After the psychometric evidence is reviewed, alternative tests and scoring procedures are described, including several that have only recently been published.

The framework draws from the existing literature and includes both theoretical and empirical considerations. Two important examples, one from international business and one from marketing, illustrate the use of the framework. Both examples concern constructs that are fundamental to theory-building in these disciplines, and constructs that most scholars measure reflectively. In contrast, applying the framework suggests that a formative measurement model may be more appropriate. These results reinforce the need for all researchers to justify, both theoretically and empirically, their choice of measurement model. Use of an incorrect measurement model undermines the content validity of constructs, misrepresents the structural relationships between them, and ultimately lowers the usefulness of management theories for business researchers and practitioners. The main contribution of this paper is to question the unthinking assumption of reflective measurement seen in much of the business literature.},

abstract = {This study focuses on the concept of Critical Design, which describes the development and use of design objects for the discussion of social and technological problem areas. Critical Design provokes or puzzles the consumer. Instead of offering people merely optimized and constraint action patterns, open situations and questions are created. The arising reactions provide valuable insights for innovative product development and basic design research. This paper assesses the potential of Critical Design approaches to be utilized as novel research tools for future challenges to design. The main contributions of this paper are threefold. Firstly, it reviews various ways of user engagement to design that reinterprets the conventional relationship of user and designer. Secondly, it selects and evaluates specific qualitative research methodologies that accept and support the active involvement of the researcher as well as the importance of letting theories "emerge" out of data, in order to develop a methodological research framework specific and original to design. Finally, the study offers an assessment of Critical Designs potential, to understand and deal with people in a novel and richer way and to test it as a research tool that supports complex approaches. Critical Design illustrates the need for design researcher to deal with complexity encountered in the general dynamic of actors and in people's critical thinking.},

abstract = {Background and aims The primary objective of the present research is to investigate the drivers of technological addiction in college students - heavy users of Information and Communication Technology (ICT). The study places cell phone and instant messaging addiction in the broader context of consumption pathologies, investigating the influence of materialism and impulsiveness on these two technologies. Clearly, cell phones serve more than just a utilitarian purpose. Cell phones are used in public and play a vital role in the lives of young adults. The accessibility of new technologies, like cell phones, which have the advantages of portability and an ever increasing array of functions, makes their over-use increasingly likely. Methods College undergraduates (N = 191) from two U.S. universities completed a paper and pencil survey instrument during class. The questionnaire took approximately 15-20 minutes to complete and contained scales that measured materialism, impulsiveness, and mobile phone and instant messaging addiction. Results Factor analysis supported the discriminant validity of Ehrenberg, Juckes, White and Walsh's (2008) Mobile Phone and Instant Messaging Addictive Tendencies Scale. The path model indicates that both materialism and impulsiveness impact the two addictive tendencies, and that materialism's direct impact on these addictions has a noticeably larger effect on cell phone use than instant messaging. Conclusions The present study finds that materialism and impulsiveness drive both a dependence on cell phones and instant messaging. As Griffiths (2012) rightly warns, however, researchers must be aware that one's addiction may not simply be to the cell phone, but to a particular activity or function of the cell phone. The emergence of multi-function smart phones requires that research must dig beneath the technology being used to the activities that draw the user to the particular technology.},

abstract = {Introduction Futures studies as a discipline and its methods have become more commonplace during the past decades. Toget-her with growing interest towards the field, also the need for information on how to apply futures studies methods in practice has increased. This concise " entry-level " guide for facili-tating futures workshops is an attempt to par-tially answer that demand. It should be noted that there are many possible ways of facilitating a futures workshop. The ACTVOD process briefly presented in this booklet shouldn't be seen as the only correct way to search for future possibilities in a workshop setting. The format of a futures workshop presented here shows how a typical workshop facilitated by the Finland Futures Research Centre (FFRC) Turku office is carried out. Typically this format is used when seeking answers to practical questions (e.g. future of an industry) and devising action plans for achieving desired future at a one-day workshop. Presented views are founded on author's experience on facilitating tens of dozens of workshops for various groups mostly in Finland between years 2006–2014. Since the purpose of this guide is to inform on practical issues related to facilitating a workshop, discussion on many interesting and important issues related to participatory methods in general and workshop method in particu-lar is kept to a minimum (for a detailed guide on using a range of participatory methods, see Slocum, 2003). Rea-der who is interested in more detailed information on characteristics of futures workshops is encouraged to familiari-se himself with key journals and textbooks of the field (See section " further reading " at the end of this document). This guide begins with a short introduction of the history and potential uses of futures workshop. After that prac-tical issues to consider before, during and after a futures workshop are presented.

abstract = {With the advent of Web 2.0, social network services (SNSs), such as Facebook and MySpace, have grown explosively and globally as one of core Web 2.0 applications. However, as revealed in other cultural comparison studies in the field of human-computer interaction, it is believed that cultural differences profoundly impact on how people use SNSs. Unfortunately, the differences in using SNSs have not been systematically investigated, so this study presents a web-based survey study among three nations: Republic of Korea, People's Republic of China, and the United States of America. It was assumed that SNS users form bridging and bonding social capital (borrowed from social capital theory) through the five functions of SNS that were categorized: Identity, Expert Search, Connection, Communication, and Contents Sharing. A correlation between social capital-related activities and usage patterns of SNS was expected. A total of 489 responded to the web-based survey through the three counties. Although the theory of cultural differences turned out to be insufficient to explain diverse usage patterns of SNSs, the results showed that Korean and Chinese users form bridging and bonding social capital mainly through Expert Search and Connection functions, but American users mainly use the Communication function to form bonding Social Capital. Various implications of these results for researchers and practitioners who work on and for SNSs are described as well.},

Some pairs of objects might be seen as being alternatives to each other (such as two pairs of jeans), while others may be seen as being complementary (such as a pair of jeans and a matching shirt). This information guides many of the choices that people make, from buying clothes to their interactions with each other. We seek here to model this human sense of the relationships between objects based on their appearance. Our approach is not based on fine-grained modeling of user annotations but rather on capturing the largest dataset possible and developing a scalable method for uncovering human notions of the visual relationships within. We cast this as a network inference problem defined on graphs of related images, and provide a large-scale dataset for the training and evaluation of the same. The system we develop is capable of recommending which clothes and accessories will go well together (and which will not), amongst a host of other applications.},

We can see that when stylizing an image with rich relative depth and spatial distance information, compared to [24], our results can better keep the original layout and relative depth relationships. ABSTRACT Neural style transfer has recently received signiicant aaention and demonstrated amazing results. An eecient solution proposed by Johnson et al. trains feed-forward convolutional neural networks by deening and optimizing perceptual loss functions. Such methods are typically based on high-level features extracted from pre-trained neural networks, where the loss functions contain two components: style loss and content loss. However, such pre-trained networks are originally designed for object recognition, and hence the high-level features ooen focus on the primary target and neglect other details. As a result, when input images contain multiple objects potentially at diierent depths, the resulting images are ooen unsatisfactory because image layout is destroyed and the boundary between the foreground and background as well as diierent objects becomes obscured. We observe that the depth map eeectively reeects the spatial distribution in an image and preserving the depth map of the content image aaer stylization helps produce an image that preserves its semantic content. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for neural style transfer that integrates depth preservation},

Due to the limited sample size (85+84 teams), the index of each latent variable, rather than the multiple indicators included in the measurement model, is used in the structural equations modeling. Because we hypothesize that each independent variable is related to each dependent variable, our structural model is saturated.
In a saturated model, the significance of the individual paths can be determined, but the overall fit of the model to the data cannot be assessed because no overall fit statistics are estimated.
{\{}{\&}{\}}gt;{\{}{\&}{\}}gt;Consequently, we are able to test each of our hypotheses but not the overall structural model.
We estimate the structural model on the self-managing and the traditionally managed team samples in order to assess the different determinants of self-managing team effectiveness and traditional team effectiveness.

Contributions:
Previous studies have been more {\{}{\&}{\}}quot;piecemeal{\{}{\&}{\}}quot;, 
looking at only a subset of predictor variables and/or components of effectiveness.
Even studies that include multiple criteria of effectiveness tend to examine only one dependent variable at a time rather than simultaneously, as is possible with causal modeling. The use of four dependent variables permits us to examine the differential effects of the predictor variables as well as the interrelationship among the dependent variables. Prior studies are vulnerable to omitted variable biases with respect to both predictor and dependent variables.
Thus, a key contribution of this research is that it simultaneously examines a more complete set of independent and dependent varaiables, thus minimizing the potential for biases.
=
This study tests a theory of self-managing work team effectiveness. It permits the examination of the relative strength of predictors drawn from competing theories of the effectivness of self-managing work teams and other groups. For each of four categroies of variables, a weighted index of the scales was defined based on the measurement model of the independent variables. 
We focused on the relationship between specific variables comprising the indices and outcomes. This follows from our interest in testing the relative strength of different theoretical explanations of self-managing team effectiveness. It also reflects the limitations of our sample size. Although our sample size is large by the standards of small group research, it is small relative to the total number of first-order variables measured.

abstract = {In immersive virtual environments (IVEs), users can control their virtual viewpoint by moving their tracked head and walking through the real world. Usually, movements in the real world are mapped one-to-one to virtual camera motions. With redirection techniques, the virtual camera is manipulated by applying gains to user motion so that the virtual world moves differently than the real world. Thus, users can walk through large-scale IVEs while physically remaining in a reasonably small workspace. In psychophysical experiments with a two-alternative forced-choice task, we have quantified how much humans can unknowingly be redirected on physical paths that are different from the visually perceived paths. We tested 12 subjects in three different experiments: (E1) discrimination between virtual and physical rotations, (E2) discrimination between virtual and physical straightforward movements, and (E3) discrimination of path curvature. In experiment E1, subjects performed rotations with different gains, and then had to choose whether the visually perceived rotation was smaller or greater than the physical rotation. In experiment E2, subjects chose whether the physical walk was shorter or longer than the visually perceived scaled travel distance. In experiment E3, subjects estimate the path curvature when walking a curved path in the real world while the visual display shows a straight path in the virtual world. Our results show that users can be turned physically about 49 percent more or 20 percent less than the perceived virtual rotation, distances can be downscaled by 14 percent and upscaled by 26 percent, and users can be redirected on a circular arc with a radius greater than 22 m while they believe that they are walking straight.},

abstract = {Facial expressions are fundamental to interpersonal communication, including social interaction, and allow people of different ages, cultures, and languages to quickly and reliably convey emotional information. Historically, facial expression research has followed from discrete emotion theories, which posit a limited number of distinct affective states that are represented with specific patterns of facial action. Much less work has focused on dimensional features of emotion, particularly positive and negative affect intensity. This is likely, in part, because achieving inter-rater reliability for facial action and affect intensity ratings is painstaking and labor-intensive. We use computer-vision and machine learning (CVML) to identify patterns of facial actions in 4,648 video recordings of 125 human participants, which show strong correspondences to positive and negative affect intensity ratings obtained from highly trained coders. Our results show that CVML can both (1) determine the importance of different facial actions that human coders use to derive positive and negative affective ratings when combined with interpretable machine learning methods, and (2) efficiently automate positive and negative affect intensity coding on large facial expression databases. Further, we show that CVML can be applied to individual human judges to infer which facial actions they use to generate perceptual emotion ratings from facial expressions.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-{\$}\alpha{\$}-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA}for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Allocation of study time across items was investigated in three experiments. According to the norm-affects-allocation hypothesis, when studying an item, a person changes the sought-after degree of learning for the item (called the norm of study) in an attempt to achieve task goals. As the norm of study is increased, more time will be allocated for study. This hypothesis was evaluated by having people pace their study of items for an eventual test of recall. As predicted, study time was greater (a) when points awarded for recalling an item increased, (b) when instructions emphasized mastering each item rather than quickly learning each item, (c) when points deducted for each second of study decreased, and (d) when the likelihood an item would be on the test increased. Also, although allocating more study time was usually accompanied by an increase in eventual recall, under several conditions people's allocation of study time appeared sub-optimal. Discussion focuses on current theory of self-paced study and people's apparent sub-optimal allocation of study time.},

We approached this problem from both an evo- lutionary and information-processing rationale and predicted that faces representing tlte average value of the population would be consistently judged as attractive. To evaluate this hypothesis, we digitized samples of male and female faces, mathematically averaged them, and had adults judge the at- tractivenes's of both the individual faces and the computer- generated composite images. Both male (three samples) and female (three samples) composite faces were judged as more attractive than almost all the individual faces comprising the composites. A strong linear trend also revealed that the com- posite faces became more attractive as more faces were entered. These data showing that attractive faces are only av- erage are consistent with evoilltionary pressures that favor characteristics close to the mean of the population and with cognitive processes that favor prototypical category members.},

In contrast, the extrinsic factors of list repetition, item repetition within a list, and stimulus duration affected JOLs less strongly than recall, supporting the proposition that extrinsic factors are discounted in making JOLs. Although practice impaired calibration, increasing underconfidence, it did improve resolution (i.e., the recall–JOL correlation). This improvement was seen to reflect a shift in the basis of JOLs with practice, from reliance on intrinsic factors, towards greater reliance on mnemonic-based heuristics.},

It is argued that to understand the variable consequences of comparison, one has to examine what target knowledge is activated during the comparison process.

Similarity testing selectively makes accessible knowledge indicating target-standard similarity, whereas dissimilarity testing selectively makes accessible knowledge indicating target-standard dissimilarity. These respective subsets of target knowledge build the basis for subsequent target evaluations, so that similarity testing typically leads to assimilation whereas dissimilarity testing typically leads to contrast.

Eyewitnesses instead construct impressions of these matters at a later time when they are asked retrospective questions about their witnessing experience. As a result,

2. their current feelings of confidence are nearly identical to their erroneous estimates of their prefeedback confidence (Semmler et al., 2002), and

Special enhancements are derived for the particular case where the individual additive components are regression trees, and tools for interpreting such "TreeBoost" models are presented. Gradient boosting of regression trees produces competitives highly robust, interpretable procedures for both regression and classification, especially appropriate for mining less than clean data.

It argues that memory of emotional experience is one of the sources for development of conceptual images during the initial stage of the design process. Memory of emotional experience is a distinct kind of memory different from the memory of events or knowledge. Memory of emotional experience triggers emotions that influence decision-making, it influences the formation of the belief and value system of a designer. Memories of emotional experience along with other kinds of experience and knowledge contribute to the construction of the image-banks that serve as a source of design ideas. The study discussed here hypothesizes that the level of creativity of design solutions is associated with thematic impulses triggered during the design process via memories of emotional experiences. A far- reaching goal of this research is the enhancement of teaching methods to help architecture students learn to use autobiographical memories as a source of design ideas},

abstract = {This article proposes a new descriptive framework, which we label as the “ideation framework” (IF), of the design process from a dual cognitive-engineering perspective, partly based on existing frameworks from both fields and previous work by the author. The framework is for the ideation or front-end phase of the product development process, representing the interface between cognitive psychology and engineering design. Three domains – inspiration, decomposition, and integration – and three spaces – problem-space, idea-space, and concept-space – are the elements of the framework. The iterative flow of the engineering design process passes through the three domains in a semi-controlled way, through a sequence of specialization and generalization process loops in and between the spaces. An empirical descriptive examination of the ideation process is performed using designers with limited design experience. The designers were faced with a design problem that they had to solve in a limited period of time. Their designs were analyzed, and a post-exercise interview was done to uncover each of the participants' design process. The empirical work indicates these designers worked in a manner largely consistent with the IF.},

We propose a Conditional Random Field model that jointly reasons about several fashionability factors such as the type of outfit and garments the user is wearing, the type of the user, the photograph's setting (e.g., the scenery behind the user), and the fashionability score. Importantly, our model is able to give rich feedback back to the user, conveying which garments or even scenery she/he should change in order to improve fashionability. We demonstrate that our joint approach significantly outperforms a variety of intelligent baselines. We additionally collected a novel heterogeneous dataset with 144,169 user posts containing diverse image, textual and meta information which can be exploited for our task. We also provide a detailed analysis of the data, showing different outfit trends and fashionability scores across the globe and across a span of 6 years.},

@article{Mendl1999,
abstract = {The way in which cognitive functioning is affected by stressors is an important area of research for applied ethologists because stress caused by captive conditions may disrupt cognitive processes and lead to welfare and husbandry problems. Such problems may be minimised through an understanding of the links between stress and cognition. The effects of stress on cognitive function have been studied in disciplines ranging from human perceptual psychology to animal neuroscience. The aim of this paper is to provide an introduction to this research, focusing on the effects of stressors on attention, memory formation and memory recall. Findings from such a diverse literature with little apparent inter-disciplinary communication are inevitably complex and often contradictory. Nevertheless, some generalities do emerge. The idea that an inverted U-shaped relationship exists between an individual's state of stress or arousal and its ability to perform a cognitive task effectively, the so-called Yerkes?Dodson law, is commonly encountered. The law has limited explanatory value because it is unlikely that different stressors act on cognitive function via the same intervening, non-specific state. Furthermore, the law only provides a very general description of the relationship between stress and cognitive function. Empirical research on attention and memory processes reveals more specific findings. Stressors appear to cause shifts, lapses and narrowing of attention, and can also influence decision speed. These processes may be viewed as serving an adaptive role helping the animal to search for and scrutinise a source of danger. There is conflicting evidence as to whether hormones involved in the hypothalamic?pituitary?adrenal stress response play a part in these processes. These hormones and those involved in the sympathetic-adrenomedullary stress response do appear to play an important role in memory formation. Low or moderate concentrations of circulating glucocorticoids and catecholamines can enhance memory formation, while excessively high or prolonged elevations of these hormones can lead to memory disruption. The effects of stressors on memory recall are less clear. There is evidence for disruptive effects, and for facilitatory effects indicating state-dependent memory recall; events experienced under conditions of high arousal may be best recalled under similar conditions. Applied ethologists have the opportunity to extend work in this area, which often involves studies of single stressors/stress hormones acting in isolation and limited measures of cognitive function, by focusing on real-life husbandry stressors encountered by captive animals. This will yield fundamental information which also has direct relevance to animal welfare and management issues.},

abstract = {In the last few years thousands of scientific papers have investigated sentiment analysis, several startups that measure opinions on real data have emerged and a number of innovative products related to this theme have been developed. There are multiple methods for measuring sentiments, including lexical-based and supervised machine learning methods. Despite the vast interest on the theme and wide popularity of some methods, it is unclear which one is better for identifying the polarity (i.e., positive or negative) of a message. Accordingly, there is a strong need to conduct a thorough apple-to-apple comparison of sentiment analysis methods, as they are used in practice, across multiple datasets originated from different data sources. Such a comparison is key for understanding the potential limitations, advantages, and disadvantages of popular methods. This article aims at filling this gap by presenting a benchmark comparison of twenty-four popular sentiment analysis methods (which we call the state-of-the-practice methods). Our evaluation is based on a benchmark of eighteen labeled datasets, covering messages posted on social networks, movie and product reviews, as well as opinions and comments in news articles. Our results highlight the extent to which the prediction performance of these methods varies considerably across datasets. Aiming at boosting the development of this research area, we open the methods' codes and datasets used in this article, deploying them in a benchmark system, which provides an open API for accessing and comparing sentence-level sentiment analysis methods.},

Single Asian Americans (N = 262) went on speed-dates (N observations = 2,181) with members of the other gender and completed questionnaires about each date. Using the social relations model, we found that communal attributes (both self-rated and perceived) and self-esteem, but not social desirability or narcissism, contributed to greater speed-dating success for men and women.

However, temporal focus has not been clearly defined nor situated in a nomological network of constructs. In addition, existing measures of temporal focus suffer from various shortcomings. In this paper, we advance the concept of temporal focus by critically examining its conceptualization, developing a new measure of temporal focus (Temporal Focus Scale; TFS), and evaluating the validity (i.e., construct, convergent, discriminant, nomological, and predictive validity) of the TFS across four studies. We conclude that understanding how individuals focus their attention toward the past, present, and future clarifies their responses to explicit and implicit temporal information, which suggests that a variety of research streams would benefit from incorporating the concept of temporal focus. {\textcopyright}2009 Elsevier Inc.

As a result, the ADASYN approach improves learning with respect to the data distributions in two ways: (1) reducing the bias introduced by the class imbalance, and (2) adaptively shifting the classification decision boundary toward the difficult examples. Simulation analyses on several machine learning data sets show the effectiveness of this method across five evaluation metrics. {\textcopyright}2008 IEEE.},

abstract = {Educational software games aim at increasing the students' motivation and engagement while they learn. However, if software games are targeted to school classrooms they have to be usable and likeable by all students. Usability of virtual reality games may be a problem because these games tend to have complex user interfaces so that they are more attractive. Moreover, if the games acquire an educational content they may lose the attractiveness and appeal that they have on users who are familiar with commercial games. Consequently, likeability may also be questioned. In this paper, we address the issue of usability and likeability of a virtual reality game that is meant to teach students geography. We describe the evaluation experiments conducted, which involved three categories of students in terms of their level of game-playing expertise: novice, intermediate and expert game players. The evaluation results showed that the game was indeed usable and likeable but there was scope for usability and likeability improvement so that the educational benefits may be maximised for all categories of students. The evaluation studies reported in this paper, revealed important issues about further research on virtual reality educational games. {\textcopyright}2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

It posits cue-dependent probabilistic sampling and recovery from an associative network, but the network is specified as a retrieval structure rather than a storage structure. A quantitative computer simulation of SAM was developed and applied to the part-list cuing paradigm. When free recall of a list of words was cued by a random subset of words from that list, the probability of recalling one of the remaining words was less than if no cues were provided at all. SAM predicted this effect in all its variations by making extensive use of interword associations in retrieval, a process that previous theorizing has dismissed.},

abstract = {Understanding subjective well-being (SWB) has historically been a core human endeavor and presently spans fields from management to mental health. Previous meta-analyses have indicated that personality traits are one of the best predictors. Still, these past results indicate only a moderate relationship, weaker than suggested by several lines of reasoning. This may be because of commensurability, where researchers have grouped together substantively disparate measures in their analyses. In this article, the authors review and address this problem directly, focusing on individual measures of personality (e.g., the Neuroticism-Extroversion-Openness Personality Inventory; P. T. Costa {\&} R. R. McCrae, 1992) and categories of SWB (e.g., life satisfaction). In addition, the authors take a multivariate approach, assessing how much variance personality traits account for individually as well as together. Results indicate that different personality and SWB scales can be substantively different and that the relationship between the two is typically much larger (e.g., 4 times) than previous meta-analyses have indicated. Total SWB variance accounted for by personality can reach as high as 39{\%} or 63{\%} disattenuated. These results also speak to meta-analyses in general and the need to account for scale differences once a sufficient research base has been generated.},

abstract = {A transition towards more sustainable food consumption requires changes in everyday eating patterns, particularly a substitution of animal protein with plant-based protein sources. However, in many European countries plant protein consumption is low compared to meat consumption. The article explores plant protein consumption frequencies, future intentions to increase bean consumption, and the associations of frequent bean eating with socioeconomic factors and bean-related meanings, material issues and competence. A population web-based survey was conducted in 2013 among 15–64-year-old Finns (n = 1048). The results showed that beans and soy-based plant proteins were infrequently consumed. A fifth of the respondents intended to increase their bean consumption in the future, intention being the greatest among those who already included beans in their diets. Frequent bean consumption was most likely among persons aged 25–34, living around the capital district, with education higher than comprehensive or vocational school, and who were vegetarian. Perceiving beans as culturally acceptable and good-tasting, and having competence in preparing bean meals were positively associated with the frequent eating of beans. The results suggest that for plant proteins to replace meat, new meanings and competences related to preparing and eating pulse-based dishes are needed. Based on our results, we build alternative future scenarios for plant protein consumption and the related requirements for changes. Several actor groups, such as NGOs, politicians, celebrity chefs and teachers of home economics have a central role in the developments.},

According to the Geneplore model (Finke, Ward, {\&} Smith, 1992), there are two phases of creativity — generating an idea and exploring the implications of the idea — each with different underlying cognitive processes. These two phases are measured in the Creative Invention Task (CIT; Finke, 1990). Younger adults (n = 41) and older adults (n = 41) completed the CIT, the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking (TTCT), and a measure of working memory capacity (Paper Folding test). In addition, the CIT was scored by both younger and older adults. There were age-related declines on both phases of the CIT, but not on the TTCT. These declines were noted by both the younger and older raters. After adjusting for working memory capacity, however, age-related differences on the CIT were nonsignificant.},

abstract = {Embodied Cognition (EC) as a learning paradigm is based on the idea of an inseparable link between body, mind, and environment. In recent years, the advent of theoretical learning approaches around EC theory has resulted in a number of empirical studies exploring the implementation of the theory in education. This systematic literature overview identifies the mainstream of EC research and emphasizes on the implementation of the theory across learning environments. Based on a corpus of 43 manuscripts, published between 2013 and 2017, it sets out to describe the range of topics covered under the umbrella of EC and provides a holistic view of the field. The aim of the present review is to investigate the main issues in EC research related to the various learning contexts. Particularly, the study addresses the research methods and technologies that are utilized, and it also explores the integration of body into the learning context. An important finding from the overview is the potential of the theory in different educational environments and disciplines. However, there is a lack of an explicit pedagogical framework from an educational perspective for a successful implementation in various learning contexts.},

Data are presented on the dimensional representation of taste, and compared with information about peripheral processing of basic tastes. While the obvious discrepancies might inspire more fascinating search for the next stage of gustatory processing, too little is known on basic emotional processing, in order to profit from a similar comparison.},

abstract = {It has been hypothesized that female orgasm evolved to facilitate recruitment of high-quality genes for offspring. Supporting evidence indicates that female orgasm promotes conception, although this may be mediated by the timing of female orgasm in relation to male ejaculation. This hypothesis also predicts that women will achieve orgasm more frequently when copulating with high-quality males, but limited data exist to support this prediction. We therefore explored relationships between the timing and frequency of women's orgasms and putative markers of the genetic quality of their mates, including measures of attractiveness, facial symmetry, dominance, and masculinity. We found that women reported more frequent and earlier-timed orgasms when mated to masculine and dominant men—those with high scores on a principal component characterized by high objectively-measured facial masculinity, observer-rated facial masculinity, partner-rated masculinity, and partner-rated dominance. Women reported more frequent orgasm during or after male ejaculation when mated to attractive men—those with high scores on a principal component characterized by high observer-rated and self-rated attractiveness. Putative measures of men's genetic quality did not predict their mates' orgasms from self-masturbation or from non-coital partnered sexual behavior. Overall, these results appear to support a role for female orgasm in sire choice.},

As a result, one of the challenges facing contemporary design educators today is how to prepare and educate design students in light of the expanding and shifting definitions of the profession as well as changes in social responsibilities. To this end, the article explores the nature of the design process by presenting a model of designing. Following from this, the inherent characteristics of design thinking are identified before discussing the application of design thinking within an education context. Reference is made to the lil'green box, a social innovation project by a final year Information Design student from the University of Pretoria. The scope of the article is limited and therefore only a single case study is presented. Nonetheless, the main argument that emerges from the case study is that in order to advance design research, focus must be placed on the design (problem solving) methodologies that are taught and subsequently employed by students as part of their design training.

Results indicated that a validated Biracial identity may serve as a protective factor for anxiety and depressive symptoms, whereas Biracial individuals who consider their race to be meaningless or fluid based on situational factors reported significantly higher levels of depression and trait anxiety symptoms than other Biracial individuals.

We identify its determinants based on the desirability–feasibility perspective and reinforcement sensitivity theory. We empirically test our model by conducting an online survey with 384 valid responses. We expect that our findings can provide noteworthy insights on the formation of compulsive smartphone use.},

abstract = {When design research builds on design practice, it can contribute to both the theory and practice of design in ways richer than research that treats design as a topic. Such research, however, faces several tensions that it must negotiate successfully in order not to lose its character as research. This paper looks at the field of constructive design research, which takes the entanglement of theory and practice as its hallmark, and uses it as a test case in exploring how design researchers can work with theory, methodology, and practice without losing their identity as design researchers. The crux of practice-based design research is that, where classical research is interested in singling out a particular aspect and exploring it in depth, design practice is characterized by balancing numerous concerns in a heterogeneous and occasionally paradoxical product. It is on this basis that the notion of design accountability is introduced and discussed. The purpose of the paper is to enable a richer and more nuanced discussion of practice-based methods in design research.},

abstract = {This research focuses on the relation between color and psychological functioning, specifically, that between red and performance attainment. Red is hypothesized to impair performance on achievement tasks, because red is associated with the danger of failure in achievement contexts and evokes avoidance motivation. Four experiments demonstrate that the brief perception of red prior to an important test (e.g., an IQ test) impairs performance, and this effect appears to take place outside of participants' conscious awareness. Two further experiments establish the link between red and avoidance motivation as indicated by behavioral (i.e., task choice) and psychophysiological (i.e., cortical activation) measures. The findings suggest that care must be taken in how red is used in achievement contexts and illustrate how color can act as a subtle environmental cue that has important influences on behavior.},

Wearing high heels enhances female physical attractiveness for the opposite sex, thus their use seems to be a powerful sexual signal. We investigated female preferences for high heels both in everyday life as well as in a hypothetical mating scenario. Slovak females reported a low frequency of wearing high heels (45{\%} once per month, 38{\%} never) in everyday life. Females with a lower body height and high self-perceived attractiveness reported more frequent use of high heels than others. Sociosexuality and involvement in a romantic relationship did not predict the wearing of high heels. When females imagined an interaction with an attractive male, preferences for high heels steeply increased compared with a scenario with an unattractive male. Females with a low body height use high heels in all probability to visually elongate their leg length in order to increase their physical attractiveness. High heels seem to be a form of sexual signalling by females in intersexual interactions.},

abstract = {Given a signed network where edges are weighted in real number, and positive weights indicate cohesion between ver-tices and negative weights indicate opposition, we are in-terested in finding k-Oppositive Cohesive Groups (k-OCG). Each k-OCG is a group of k subgraphs such that (1) the edges within each subgraph are dense and cohesive; and (2) the edges crossing different subgraphs are dense and opposi-tive. Finding k-OCGs is challenging since the subgraphs are often small, there are multiple k-OCGs in a large signed net-work, and many existing dense subgraph extraction methods cannot handle edges of two signs. We model k-OCG find-ing task as a quadratic optimization problem. However, the classical Proximal Gradient method is very costly since it has to use the entire adjacency matrix, which is huge on large networks. Thus, we develop FOCG, an algorithm that is two orders of magnitudes faster than the Proximal Gra-dient method. The main idea is to only search in small subgraphs and thus avoids using a major portion of the ad-jacency matrix. Our experimental results on synthetic and real data sets as well as a case study clearly demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.},

As such political marketing efforts proliferate, the factors that drive electoral success warrant greater attention and investigation. The authors employ a combination of laboratory studies and analysis of actual election results to reveal influences of candidate appearance and spending strategies in campaigns. They analyze how personality trait inferences based on candidate appearance interact with political party brand image, advertising spending, and negative advertising. The results indicate that appearance-based inferences about candidates influence election outcomes, but their impact is driven partially by trait associations at the party brand level. This interaction between appearance and party alters the effects of advertising spending, particularly the effects of negative advertising. The findings have implications for the marketing of political candidates in terms of their party's brand image. {\textcopyright} 2011, American Marketing Association.},

The solution was implemented in an industrial setting in a major IT project with over 50 project members. Beyond this, it also served as a feedback tool for all software engineers.

abstract = {Deep learning algorithms involve optimization in many contexts. For example, we often solve optimization problems analytically in order to prove that an algorithm has a certain property. Inference in a probabilistic model can be cast as an optimization problem. Of all of the many optimization problems involved in deep learning, the most difficult is neural network training. It is quite common to invest days to months of time on hundreds on machines in order to solve even a single instance of the neural network training problem. Because this problem is so important and so expensive, a specialized set of optimization techniques have been developed for solving it. This chapter presents these optimization techniques for neural network training. If you're unfamiliar with the basic principles of gradient-based optimization, we suggest reviewing Chapter 4. That chapter includes a brief overview of nu-merical optimization in general. This chapter focuses on one particular case of optimization: minimizing an objective function J(X (train) , {\{}{\$}\backslash{\$}ensuremath{\{}{\$}\backslash{\$}theta{\}}{\}}) with respect to the model parameters {\{}{\$}\backslash{\$}ensuremath{\{}{\$}\backslash{\$}theta{\}}{\}}. 8.1 Optimization for Model Training Optimization algorithms used for training of deep models differ from traditional optimization algorithms in several ways.

However, we also present a factorial respecification that satisfies more recent model fit thresholds. Beyond validating the original DFS-2 instrument in the context of gamification, the psychometric analysis and the respecifications suggest that the components of flow divide into highly correlated conditions of flow (which were also found to be more salient in the context of gamification: autotelic experience, balance of skill and challenge, control, clear goals, and feedback) and into possible outcomes (merging action-awareness, concentration, loss of sense of time, and loss of self-consciousness) from achieving flow. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This study was conducted with 360 men and women students from the Public University of Navarra enrolled in applied sociology, social work, and specialising in infant and primary education. Participants were given the Adult Creative Imagination Test and the Creative Metacognition Scale during their regular school schedule and during a single session. The results showed that the relationships between the assessed variables were significant and positive. Furthermore, metacognition moderately predicted narrative creativity; thus, cognitive processes do not operate in isolation because they affect and are affected by other factors. The findings also revealed that students obtained different results with regard to verbal and graphic creativity, and men and women differed only in narrative creative potential. The most important conclusion to be drawn from this research is that creative and metacognitive skills should be explicitly involved in higher education to stimulate the creative potential of future professionals.},

The results revealed that happiness and self-esteem, while highly correlated ( r = 0.58), presented unique patterns of relations with the other measured variables. The best predictors of happiness were the following: mood and temperamental traits (i.e., extraversion and neuroticism), social relationships (lack of loneliness and satisfaction with friendships), purpose in life, and global life satisfaction. By contrast, self-esteem was best predicted by dispositions related to agency and motivation (i.e., optimism and lack of hopelessness). Implications for the understanding of happiness and self-esteem are discussed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract = {Extraversion has been shown to positively correlate with activation within the ventral striatum, amygdala and other dopaminergically innervated, reward-sensitive regions. These regions are implicated in emotional responding, in a manner sensitive to attentional focus. However, no study has investigated the interaction among extraversion, emotion and attention. We used fMRI and dynamic, evocative film clips to elicit amusement and sadness in a sample of 28 women. Participants were instructed either to respond naturally (n = 14) or to attend to and continuously rate their emotions (n = 14) while watching the films. Contrary to expectations, striatal response was negatively associated with extraversion during amusement, regardless of attention. A negative association was also observed during sad films, but only when attending to emotion. These findings suggest that attentional focus does not influence the relationship between extraversion and neural response to positive (amusing) stimuli but does impact the response to negative (sad) stimuli. {\textcopyright} The Author (2008).

In addition, we consider a second, highly salient body of literature emerging from the relatively new field of social cognitive neuroscience, which uses brain imaging to help identify the physiological components of emotional and cognitive processes. We believe that social cognitive neuroscience can assist social work in clarifying concrete, consistent ways of defining and measuring empathy as a neurological phenomenon. Finally, we assess some of the most recent social work-related empirical intervention-based research on empathy. Combining all these research traditions leads to a compelling possibility: a unified, consistent, and robust way to define and measure the empathic responses that help form the foun- dation of just and beneficent social structures.},

Our flexible and efficient mesh-based hair representation is suitable for a wide range of hairstyles and can be readily integrated into existing real-time game engines. All of the illustrations are rendered in realtime in Unity. President Trump's picture is obtained from whitehouse.gov and Kim Jong-un's photograph was published in the Rodong Sinmun. The other celebrity pictures are used with permission from Getty Images. We present a fully automatic framework that digitizes a complete 3D head with hair from a single unconstrained image. Our system offers a practical and consumer-friendly end-to-end solution for avatar personalization in gaming and social VR applications. The reconstructed models include sec-ondary components (eyes, teeth, tongue, and gums) and provide animation-friendly blendshapes and joint-based rigs. While the generated face is a high-quality textured mesh, we propose a versatile and efficient polygonal strips (polystrips) representation for the hair. Polystrips are suitable for an extremely wide range of hairstyles and textures and are compatible with existing game engines for real-time rendering. In addition to integrating state-of-the-art advances in facial shape modeling and appearance infer-ence, we propose a novel single-view hair generation pipeline, based on 3D-model and texture retrieval, shape refinement, and polystrip patching optimization. The performance of our hairstyle retrieval is enhanced using a deep convolutional neural network for semantic hair attribute classifi-cation. Our generated models are visually comparable to state-of-the-art game characters designed by professional artists. For real-time settings, we demonstrate the flexibility of polystrips in handling hairstyle variations, as opposed to conventional strand-based representations. We further show the effectiveness of our approach on a large number of images taken in the wild, and how compelling avatars can be easily created by anyone.},

abstract = {Design managers are called upon to enhance their competences at various levels within the corporate environment. Accordingly, this study aims to establish a competence model for design managers (CMDM). The CMDM was established through deductive content analysis of pertinent international journal articles. The study further investigates the competences perceived to be important for middle-level design managers through a survey conducted in South Korea. To establish the diverse ways in which middle managers are engaged in the product development process, survey respondents were divided into three different design functions: front-end focused, back-end focused, and intermediate. We found that generic design managers identified strategic and tactical competences to be most important, and operational competence (i.e., design expertise) to have medium importance. Moreover, middle-level design managers required a broad spectrum of competences to understand both top management and actual practice; they demonstrated more tactical and operational competences than generic design managers did. The three design functions represented different patterns of importance: those with a front-end focus exhibited a strategic orientation and a generalist manager's perspective; those with a back-end focus showed a practical orientation and a specialist manager's perspective; and those in the intermediate group demonstrated both types of characteristics. This study also provides a portfolio of exemplary competences for middle-level design managers segmented by design function. {\textcopyright}2015 Kang, Chung, {\&} Nam.},

abstract = {The dangers of mindless behaviors remain better defined than their remedies. Even as mindfulness becomes increasingly prevalent, we lack clarity on three key questions: What is mindfulness? How does mindfulness training operate? And why might mindfulness matter for organizations? In this article, I introduce a new conceptualization of mindfulness called metacognitive practice. Metacognitive practice is so-named because it blends insights from metacognition and practice theory to answer these three key questions. First, when seen as metacognitive practice, mindfulness is not a single mode of information processing to be applied in all situations. Instead, mindfulness is a metacognitive process by which people adjust their mode of information processing to their current situation. Second, this metacognitive process is made possible by three specific beliefs that supersede lay beliefs about human information processing. A core function of mindfulness training is thus to provide a context that cultivates these beliefs. And third, when these beliefs are put into practice, people gain greater agency in how they respond to situations. This matters for organizations because as people interrelate their individual actions into a collective response, metacognitive practice can get embedded in amplifying processes that transform the organization—or in fragmentation processes that threaten it.},

al. (1989). The scale was modified such that the team served as the referent,
rather than the individual. Trainees indicated, on a 5-point scale ranging
from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (5), the extent to which their
team cares if they achieve the goal or not, is strongly committed to
pursuing the goal, would be likely to abandon the goal, thinks that the goal
is a good goal to shoot for, and is willing to put in a great deal of effort to
achieve the goal. Factor analysis indicated a one-factor solution. Coefficient
alpha for this scale ranged from .83 to .89 for the two administrations.
ICC(1) obtained provided justification for aggregating
this measure to the team level of analysis by calculating the average
value within teams.

goal orientation
Team performance goal orientation was measured with a modified
version of the six-item performance goal orientation scale developed by
Button et al. (1996). The modification entailed changing the referent from
individual to team. Because this study used ad hoc teams with no prior
history, it was necessary to allow the team to have substantial interaction
prior to administering this measure. Thus, this measure was administered at
the conclusion of the study. Team members indicated, on a 5-point Likert
scale ranging from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (5), the extent to
which their team enjoys most what they do best, feels smart when they do
something without making mistakes, likes to work on tasks that they have
done well on in the past, feels smart when they can do something better
than most other teams, views the opinions of others concerning the team?s
performance as important, and likes to be fairly confident that they can
successfully perform a task before they attempt it.},

abstract = {Predicting stock market movements is a well-known problem of interest. Now-a-days social media is perfectly representing the public sentiment and opinion about current events. Especially, twitter has attracted a lot of attention from researchers for studying the public sentiments. Stock market prediction on the basis of public sentiments expressed on twitter has been an intriguing field of research. Previous studies have concluded that the aggregate public mood collected from twitter may well be correlated with Dow Jones Industrial Average Index (DJIA). The thesis of this work is to observe how well the changes in stock prices of a company, the rises and falls, are correlated with the public opinions being expressed in tweets about that company. Understanding author's opinion from a piece of text is the objective of sentiment analysis. The present paper have employed two different textual representations, Word2vec and N-gram, for analyzing the public sentiments in tweets. In this paper, we have applied sentiment analysis and supervised machine learning principles to the tweets extracted from twitter and analyze the correlation between stock market movements of a company and sentiments in tweets. In an elaborate way, positive news and tweets in social media about a company would definitely encourage people to invest in the stocks of that company and as a result the stock price of that company would increase. At the end of the paper, it is shown that a strong correlation exists between the rise and falls in stock prices with the public sentiments in tweets.},

According to this methodology, parcels are acceptable indicators of the latent construct if the 2-facet model meets parametric assumptions for unidimensionality and if items and parcels have content validity as measures of the latent construct. The proposed methodology is illustrated using a 1-factor model of the Worry construct in the test anxiety measurement tradition.},

The I-PANAS-SF is composed of two ten-item mood scales: one to measure positive affectivity and the other to measure negativity affectivity. Participants of this study included 423 university students from two national cultures: 111 from city of Aix-en-Provence, France (49 males, 62 females), and 310 from city of Quetta in the province of Balochistan, Pakistan (168 males and 142 females). Multigroup structural equation models were proposed in order to compare the factor structure of the I-PANAS-SF across two cultures. Results indicated that university students across the two cultural groups interpreted I-PANAS-SF 10 items in a similar manner regardless of their cultural backgrounds. {\textcopyright} 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Sociometer theory proposes that self-esteem is an adaptation which evolved to monitor and regulate interpersonal relationships. It is therefore sensitive to self-assessments in domains relevant to relational desirability. Positive relationships between self-perceived physical attractiveness and self-esteem found in previous studies may reflect the functioning of a mating sociometer, designed to monitor individuals' desirability as romantic or sexual partners. We thus predicted that these relationships should be mediated by self-perceptions of romantic desirability, or more specifically, individuals' confidence in their abilities to successfully establish and maintain romantic relationships. Two hundred and eighty seven young adults (98 male) completed an online measure of self-perceived attractiveness, together with measures of self-confidence in appearance and romantic relationships, body-esteem and global self-esteem. Linear regression analyses indicated that self-perceived attractiveness, self-confidence in appearance and body-esteem all significantly predicted self-esteem, and that in each case, the relationship was mediated by romantic self-confidence. Self-perceived attractiveness predicted self-esteem significantly more strongly in females than in males. We discuss these results in relation to sociometer and parental investment theories, and explore limitations and future directions.},

Moderating influences of IQ tests, IQ score levels, creativity tests, creativity subscales, creativity test types, gender, age, and below and above the threshold (IQ 120) were examined. Four hundred forty-seven correlation coefficients from 21 studies and 45,880 participants were retrieved. The mean correlation coefficient was small (r = .174; 95{\%} CI = .165 – .183), but heterogeneous; this correlation coefficient indicates that the relationship between creativity test scores and IQ scores is negligible. Age contributed to the relationship between intelligence and creativity the most; different creativity tests contributed to it secondly. This study does not support threshold theory.},

Construct validity refers to the extent to which a measure performs in accordance with
theoretical expectations. As Carmines and Zeller (1979: 23) describe it, construct validity is
fundamentally {\{}{\&}{\}}quot;concerned with the extent to which a particular measure relates to other measures
consistent with theoretically derived hypotheses concerning the concepts (or constructs) that are
being measured.{\{}{\&}{\}}quot; In practice, construct validation begins by specifying a theoretical relationship
between two or more concepts, followed by empirical examination of this relationship and
interpretation of the results. The impact of a successful case of construct validation depends on the
nature of the theoretical relationship that was specified; evidence supporting a more rigorous and
demanding relationship will provide greater confidence in the construct validity of the measure
being assessed.
Carmines and Zeller (1979) consider construct validity the most useful form of validity for
the social sciences, given the weaknesses of criterion-related and content validity for many abstract
social science concepts. They note, though, that a potentially serious problem in assessing
construct validity involves the conclusions to be drawn when a measure behaves inconsistently
with theoretical expectations (Carmines and Zeller 1979: 25-26). The most common inference in
such a situation is that the empirical measure does not adequately represent the underlying
theoretical concept, indicating a lack of construct validity for that particular concept. Alternative
inferences include the possibilities that the theoretical framework used to generate the relationship
is incorrect, the testing methodology is flawed or inappropriate, or that the other variable(s) in the
hypothesized relationship are flawed (while the measure being assessed may actually be highly
valid). Although certain types of evidence may help to rule out one or more of these possibilities,
Carmines and Zeller (1979: 25) note that there is no foolproof procedure for determining which is
correct in any given case.

However, the majority of research has focused on self-esteem at the individual and the collective level, but has mostly ignored self-esteem at the relational level. According to social identity theory, individuals can maintain and enhance self-esteem through personal traits (personal self-esteem, PSE), relationships with significant others (relational self-esteem, RSE), and relationships with larger groups (collective self-esteem, CSE). The current research investigated whether RSE and CSE can predict subjective well-being beyond PSE among Chinese college students. With four cross-sectional studies and one longitudinal study (N = 847), we found that, when controlling for PSE, RSE was associated with greater life satisfaction, positive affect, meaning in life, happiness, and subjective vitality (Studies 1–5), but CSE was not (Studies 2–5).

The results show that neural network out of sample minimum sensitivity and overall classification performance are indifferent to the scaling of the categorical inputs. However, the encoding of inputs had a significant impact on classification accuracy and utilising ordinal or thermometer encoding approaches for categorical inputs significantly increases the out of sample accuracy of the neural network classifier. These findings confirm that the impact of categorical encoding is problem specific for an ordinal approach, and support thermometer encoding as most suitable for categorical inputs. The classification performance of neural networks was compared against a logistic regression model and the results show that in this instance, the non-parametric approach does not offer any advantage over standard statistical models. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.},

In so doing, the study investigates how initial self-congruity and flow affect the ways consumers evaluate interface designs and form a behavioral intention. The analysis was based on 673 responses collected via an online survey evaluating clothing retail sites. The results indicate that a consumer makes an instantaneous judgment of the congruity between the self and the site images immediately upon visiting the site, which in turn biases the way he/she evaluates specific design elements of the website. The results also show that a consumer's flow state with the website mediates the effects of design evaluations on his/her purchase intention from the site. The flow state is most significantly determined by the evaluation of visual elements, followed by information/navigation designs as well as transaction designs.},

This results in an evaluation criterion of grouping, which is minimal for the most probable grouping given the data, i.e. the Bayes optimal grouping. We propose new super-linear optimization heuristics that yields near-optimal groupings.

She holds a formidable lead on many items in this category, including being qualified to be president and being a strong leader (Saad 2007). {\textcopyright}2008 Copyright The American Political Science Association 2008.},

Despite of the rising interest, no shared conceptualization or a clear-cut breakdown of the concept seems to exist. However, in order to evaluate these claims and further develop the understanding on design thinking, its use, application, benefits and limitations, a shared understanding and conceptualization of the concept is needed. Furthermore, as there are two differing discourses discussing design thinking, one in design and the other in management, in this paper the focus is on the management discourse on design thinking. Building on a literature review of the management discourse, this paper proposes an initial framework portraying the elements of design thinking. In the framework we conclude design thinking as consisting of three dimensions: practices, thinking styles, and mentality. Each dimension contains a set of elements of design thinking – methods, values, and concepts that repeatedly surfaced across the reviewed literature.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to develop a self-diagnostic scale that could distinguish smartphone addicts based on the Korean self-diagnostic program for Internet addiction (K-scale) and the smartphone's own features. In addition, the reliability and validity of the smartphone addiction scale (SAS) was demonstrated. METHODS A total of 197 participants were selected from Nov. 2011 to Jan. 2012 to accomplish a set of questionnaires, including SAS, K-scale, modified Kimberly Young Internet addiction test (Y-scale), visual analogue scale (VAS), and substance dependence and abuse diagnosis of DSM-IV. There were 64 males and 133 females, with ages ranging from 18 to 53 years (M = 26.06; SD = 5.96). Factor analysis, internal-consistency test, t-test, ANOVA, and correlation analysis were conducted to verify the reliability and validity of SAS. RESULTS Based on the factor analysis results, the subscale "disturbance of reality testing" was removed, and six factors were left. The internal consistency and concurrent validity of SAS were verified (Cronbach's alpha = 0.967). SAS and its subscales were significantly correlated with K-scale and Y-scale. The VAS of each factor also showed a significant correlation with each subscale. In addition, differences were found in the job (p{\textless}0.05), education (p{\textless}0.05), and self-reported smartphone addiction scores (p{\textless}0.001) in SAS. CONCLUSIONS This study developed the first scale of the smartphone addiction aspect of the diagnostic manual. This scale was proven to be relatively reliable and valid.},

In this model, the AD method is extended to cover the whole product development lifecycle, including the test domain, and new domain characteristic vectors are introduced to systematically capture and manage the input constraints and system components. The TPDL model helps develop, capture, and present both the big-picture and a detailed view of the product development knowledge, including design and requirement traceability knowledge.

Exps 1 and 2 indicated that LSE Ss sought the most social comparisons after receiving success feedback, whereas high-self-esteem (HSE) Ss sought the most comparisons after failure. Further results suggested that LSE Ss who succeeded were seizing a safe means of self-enhancement and that HSE Ss who failed were seeking to compensate for the failure. Also supporting this interpretation for LSE Ss was Exp 3, in which LSE Ss who succeeded sought the most comparisons when such comparisons promised to be favorable.

Currently, the adopted computer-aided design tools offer functionality mostly based on low-level geometric elements, while designers would like to act on properties more directly connected with their design intent. In order to understand which properties are important, we deeply analysed the process followed by designers and computer-aided design operators for achieving the desired product. The possible relationships between shape geometry and aesthetic character have been investigated and a software prototype has been developed to demonstrate the validity of the research outcomes. The presented work has been mainly developed within the framework of a Research and Development project supported by the European Commission, named FIORES-II, which involved, beside several research institutions from different European countries, a wide and direct participation of industrial application companies, such as Alessi, BMW, Pininfarina, Saab, Formtech and Eiger.},

In recent years, there has been an increasing attention in the literature on the possibility of analyzing social media as a useful complement to traditional off-line polls to monitor an electoral campaign. Some scholars claim that by doing so, we can also produce a forecast of the result. Relying on a proper methodology for sentiment analysis remains a crucial issue in this respect. In this work, we apply the supervised method proposed by Hopkins and King to analyze the voting intention of Twitter users in the United States (for the 2012 Presidential election) and Italy (for the two rounds of the centre-left 2012 primaries). This methodology presents two crucial advantages compared to traditionally employed alternatives: a better interpretation of the texts and more reliable aggregate results. Our analysis shows a remarkable ability of Twitter to “nowcast” as well as to forecast electoral results.},

abstract = {Introduction: Research in the field of meta comprehension often uses the accuracy of judgments of own knowledge as a measure of monitoring which is a central component of meta cognition. One aim of this study is to investigate if the accuracy above chance usually found in studies using traditional texts can be replicated with hypermedia. More importantly, the study investigates differences between the accuracy of monitoring in two kinds of tests: a comprehension test and a transfer test. Method: To investigate these questions, 126 university students learnt the basic concepts of operant conditioning presented in a hypermedia system within 30 minutes. Immediately afterward, a comprehension test and a transfer test were administered. For each test, the students predicted their knowledge just before it was administered and retrospectively judged their confidence regarding each item. Results: The results showed that the students' accuracy of monitoring was above chance. Further, accuracy of retrospective judgments was higher in the comprehension test than in the transfer test, and the predictive judgment was less accurate than retrospective judgments in the comprehension test, but not in the transfer test. Structural equation modeling rendered no evidence that this difference in accuracy between the two tests was due to differences in the use of experience-based cues. Discussion and Conclusion: The results are discussed with regard to the distinction between theory-based and experience-based cues and with regard to the accessibility hypothesis.

The aim of this study was to determine to what extent the overall product noisiness is attributed to the sounds that the products make and to what extent is it attributed to the visual appearance of the products. We manipulated the auditory and visual properties of alarm clocks and whistling kettles by combining noisy and quiet stimuli of the two sensory modalities according to a full factorial design. Participants in our experiment assessed the noisiness, pleasantness, and annoyance of the products. The results demonstrated that noisiness and annoyance of the products were generally dominated by the product sound, whereas contribution from visual patterns was insignificant. The noisiness of the sound had a negative influence on the overall pleasantness of the products. The results suggest that in order to create pleasurable product experience, designers need to pay more attention to the auditory properties of products.},

abstract = {This paper takes a critical look at the design thinking discourse, one that has different meanings depending on its context. Within the managerial realm, design thinking has been described as the best way to be creative and innovate, while within the design realm, design thinking may be partly ignored and taken for granted, despite a long history of academic development and debate. In the design area, we find five different discourses of ‘designerly thinking', or ways to describe what designers do in practice, that have distinctly different epistemological roots. These different discourses do not stand in competition with each other but could be developed in parallel. We also observe that the management discourse has three distinct origins, but in general has a more superficial and popular character and is less academically anchored than the designerly one. Also, the management design thinking discourse seldom refers to designerly thinking and thereby hinders cumulative knowledge construction. We suggest further research to link the discourses.},

@book{James2013,
abstract = {3'-Azido-2',3'-dideoxythymidine (AZT, 1, zidovudine, RetrovirTM) is used to treat patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. AZT, after conversion to AZT-5'-triphosphate (AZT-TP) by cellular enzymes, inhibits HIV-reverse transcriptase (HIV-RT). The major clinical limitations of AZT are due to clinical toxicities that include bone marrow suppression, hepatic abnormalities and myopathy, absolute dependence on host cell kinase-mediated activation which leads to low activity, limited brain uptake, a short half-life of about one hour in plasma that dictates frequent administration to maintain therapeutic drug levels, low potential for metabolic activation and/or high susceptibility to catabolism, and the rapid development of resistance by HIV-1. These limitations have prompted the development of strategies for designing prodrugs of AZT. A variety of 5'-O-substituted prodrugs of AZT constitute the subject of this review. The drug-design rationale on which these approaches are based is that the ester conjugate will be converted by hydrolysis and/or enzymatic cleavage to AZT or its 5{\&}prime;-monophosphate (AZT-MP). Most prodrug derivatives of AZT have been prepared by derivatization of AZT at its 5'-O position to provide two prominent classes of compounds that encompass: A) 5'-O-carboxylic esters derived from 1) cyclic 5'-O-carboxylic acids such as steroidal 17b-carboxylic acids, 1-adamantanecarboxylic acid, bicyclam carboxylic acid derivatives, O-acetylsalicylic acid, and carbohydrate derivatives, 2) amino acids, 3) 1, 4-dihydro-1-methyl-3-pyridinylcarboxylic acid, 4) aliphatic fatty acid analogs such as myristic acid containing a heteroatom, or without a heteroatom such as stearic acid, and 5) long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid analogs such as retinoic acid, and B) masked phosphates such as 1) phosphodiesters that include monoalkyl or monoaryl phosphate, carbohydrate, ether lipid, ester lipid, and foscarnet derivatives, 2) a variety of phosphotriesters that include dialkylphosphotriesters, diarylphosphotriesters, glycolate and lactate phosphotriesters, phosphotriester approaches using simultaneous enzymatic and chemical hydrolysis of bis(4-acyloxybenzyl) esters, bis(S-acyl-2-thioethyl) (SATE) esters, cyclosaligenyl prodrugs, glycosyl phosphotriesters, and steroidal phosphotriesters, 3) phosphoramidate derivatives, 4) dinucleoside phosphate derivatives that possess a second anti-HIV moiety such as AZT-P-ddA, AZT-P-ddI, AZTP2AZT, AZTP2ACV), and 5) 5'-hydrogen phosphonate and 5'-methylene phosphonate derivatives of AZT. In these prodrugs, the conjugating moiety is linked to AZT via a 5'-O-ester or 5'-O-phosphate group. 5'-O-Substituted AZT prodrugs have been designed with the objectives of improving anti-HIV activity, enhancing blood-brain barrier penetration, modifying pharmacokinetic properties to increase plasma half-life and improving drug delivery with respect to site-specific targeting or drug localization. Bypassing the first phosphorylation step, regulating transport and conferring sustained release of AZT prolong its duration of action, decrease toxicity and improve patient acceptability. The properties of these prodrugs and their anti-HIV activities are now reviewed.},

abstract = {It is widely accepted that the amygdala plays a crucial role in the processing of emotions. The precise nature of its involvement is however unclear. We hypothesized that ambivalent findings from neuroimaging studies that report amygdala's activity in emotions, are due to distinct functional specificity of amygdala's sub-divisions and specifically to differential reactivity to arousal and valence. The goal of the present study is to characterize the amygdala response to affective stimuli by disentangling the contributions of arousal and valence. Our hypothesis was prompted by recent reports claiming anatomical sub-divisions of amygdala based on cytoarchitecture and the functional maps obtained from diverse behavioral, emotional, and physiological stimulation. We measured magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings from 12 healthy individuals passively exposed to affective stimuli from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) collection using a 2 (Valence levels). ??. 2 (Arousal levels) design. Source power was estimated using a beamformer technique with the activations referring to the amygdala sub-divisions defined through probabilistic cytoarchitectonic maps. Right laterobasal amygdala activity was found to mediate negative valence (elicited by unpleasant stimuli) while left centromedial activity was characterized by an interaction of valence by arousal (arousing pleasant stimuli). We did not find a main effect for amygdala activations in any of its sub-divisions for arousal modulation. To the best of our knowledge, our findings from non-invasive MEG data indicate for the first time, a distinct functional specificity of amygdala anatomical sub-divisions in the emotional processing. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {A. Koriat's (1997) cue-utilization framework provided a significant advance in understanding how people make judgments of learning (JOLs). A major distinction is made between intrinsic and extrinsic cues. JOLs are predicted to be sensitive to intrinsic cues (e.g., item relatedness) and less sensitive to extrinsic cues (e.g., serial position) because JOLs are comparative across items in a list. The authors evaluated predictions by having people make JOLs after studying either related (poker-flush) or unrelated (dog-spoon) items. Although some outcomes confirmed these predictions, others could not be readily explained by the framework. Namely, relatedness influenced JOLs even when manipulated between participants, primacy effects were evident on JOLs, and the order in which blocks of items were presented (either all related items first or all unrelated items first) influenced JOLs. The authors discuss the framework in relation to these and other outcomes.},

The approach we propose is centred on designers' cognitive processes. We argue that both the development of new CAD (computer-aided design) systems and their assessment should be conducted on the basis of a deep understanding of designers' cognitive processes. In accordance with this view, we present three empirical studies that were conducted in order to analyse the impact of new design support systems on designers' cognitive processes. Therefore, the results we present contribute to further our knowledge of whether new CAD technologies effectively facilitate designers' activities and enhance their creativity. },

abstract = {Background: Oxytocin exerts well accepted effects on one of the key social processes: empathy. Previous researches have demonstrated that oxytocin promotes emotional and cognitive aspects of empathy, by exogenous administration as well as on gene level. However, the effect of diverse gene locus haplotypes of oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) on trait empathy lacks reliable evidence. Methods: Participants consisted of 101 genetically unrelated, non-clinical Chinese subjects (46 males and 55 females). Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) was applied to measure the trait empathy from four dimensions: empathy concern, personal distress, perspective taking and fantasy. Fantasy and perspective taking measured cognitive aspect of empathy, while empathy concern and personal distress measured emotional aspect of empathy. Ten single tagging SNPs on OXTR rs2268491, rs1042778, rs53576, rs7632287, rs2254298, rs13316193, rs237897, rs237887, rs4686302, and rs2268493 were tested. Results: Genotype difference in emotional empathy was found on rs237887 and rs4686302 whereas cognitive empathy varied on SNPs rs2268491 and rs2254298 between homozygous and variant carriers. For IRI score, there is a genotype and gender interaction on rs4686302 and rs13316193. Limitation: The sample sizes from the current study were not so optimal that these results should have to be interpreted with caution when amplified into a larger population. Conclusion: The findings demonstrate that natural variants of OXTR associated with trait empathy; specifically, individuals with certain OXTR genotype did perform better on trait empathy, while others did not.

Existing typologies are either too concise or too comprehensive, including less than five or hundreds of positive emotions, respectively. To overcome this hindrance, this paper introduces a basic set of 25 positive emotion types that represent the general repertoire of positive human emotions. The set was developed with a componential analysis of 150 positive emotion words. A questionnaire study that explored how and when each of the 25 emotions are experienced in human-product interactions resulted in a collection of 729 example cases. On the basis of these cases, six main sources of positive emotions in human-product interactions are proposed. By providing a fine-grained yet concise vocabulary of positive emotions that people can experience in response to product design, the typology aims to facilitate both research and design activities. The implications and limitations of the set are discussed, and some future research steps are proposed.},

p. 841-844 definiton of self-regulation

- Definition
Self-regulation refers to the self exerting control over itself. In particular, self-regulation consists of deliberate efforts by the self to alter its own states and responses, including behavior, thoughts, impulses or appetites, emotions, and task performance. The concept of self-regulation is close to the colloquial terms self-control and self-discipline, and many social psychologists use the terms interchangeably. 

- History and Background
Early social psychologists did not use the term self-regulation and, if they thought about it at all, regarded it as a minor, obscure, technical problem. However, as the study of the self expanded and researchers became more interested in inner processes, interest in self-regulation expanded. By the 1990s, self-regulation had become widely recognized as a central function of the self, with both practical and theoretical importance, and a broad range of research sought to contribute to the rapidly expanding research literature on self-regulation.

[p. 842]
Modern self-regulation theory has several roots. One is in the study of animal learning. Skinnerian behaviorists taught that animals learn behaviors based on past rewards and punishments. In that way, behavior patterns are molded by the external environment. Recognizing that human behavior was more complex and internally guided than much animal behavior, thoughtful behaviorists such as Albert Bandura proposed that people self-regulate by administering rewards and punishments to themselves. For example, a person might say, {\{}{\&}{\}}quot;If I can get this task done by 7 o'clock, I will treat myself to ice cream,{\{}{\&}{\}}quot; or {\{}{\&}{\}}quot;If I don't get this paper written today, I won't go to the movies.{\{}{\&}{\}}quot;
A second root is in research on delay of gratification. In the 1960s, researchers such as Walter Mischel began to study how people would choose between a small immediate reward and a larger, delayed one. For example, a child might be told, {\{}{\&}{\}}quot;You can have one cookie now, but if you can wait for 20 minutes without eating it, you can have three cookies.{\{}{\&}{\}}quot; In adult life, most work and study activities depend on the capacity to delay gratification, insofar as work and studying bring delayed rewards but are often not immediately satisfying (as compared with relaxing or engaging in hobbies). This line of research found that successful delaying of gratification depended on overriding immediate impulses and focusing attention away from the immediate gratification. The immediate response to a tempting stimulus is to enjoy it now, so it requires self-regulation to override that response to wait for the delayed but better reward.
A third root is in the study of self-awareness. During the 1970s, researchers began studying how behavior changes when people focus attention on themselves. In 1981, the book Attention and Self-Regulation by Charles Carver and Michael Scheier proposed that one main function of self-awareness is to aid in self-regulation. That is, you reflect on yourself as a way of deciding how and whether improvement would be desirable.
The fourth root of self-regulation theory is in research on human personal problems, many of which revolve around failures at self-control. Across recent decades, research has steadily accumulated to reveal the importance of self-regulation in many spheres of behavior. Eating disorders and obesity partly reflect failures to regulate one's food intake. Alcohol and drug addiction likewise indicate poor regulation of use of these substances. Research on these and related issues has provided much information that self-regulation theorists could use.

- Importance
Self-regulation has implications for both psychological theory and for practical, applied issues. In terms of theory, self-regulation has come to be seen as one of the most important operations of the human self. Indeed, the human capacity for self-regulation appears to be far more advanced and powerful than is self-regulation in most other animals, and it helps set the human self apart from selfhood in other species. Some theorists believe that the capacity for self-regulation was one decisive key to human evolution.
Self-regulation depicts the self as an active controller. Social psychology's early theories and research on the self focused mainly on issues such as self-concept and self-knowledge, and in that sense, the self was treated as an accumulated set of ideas. In contrast, self-regulation theory recognizes the self as an active agent that measures, decides, and intervenes in its own processes to change them. Some psychologists link self-regulation to the philosophical notion of free will, understood as the ability to determine one's actions from inside onself rather than being driven by external forces.
The practical importance of self-regulation can scarcely be understated. Most personal and social problems that plague modern society have some degree of self-regulation at their core. These include addiction and alcoholism, obesity and binge eating, anger management, and other emotional contro problems. Crime and violence are often linked to ppor self-regulation (especially of aggressive and antisocial impulses). Sexual problems, including unwanted pregnancy and sexually tansmitted diseases, can be avoided with effective self-regulation. Underachievement in school and work often reflects inadequate self-regulation. Money problems, whether in the form of gambling losses, failure to save for the future, or impulsive shopping and credit card debt, can also indicate inadequate self-regulation. Many health problems could be prevented by self-regulation, such as to ensure that one exercises regularly, brushes and flosses teeth, takes vitamins, and eats a proper diet.
More broadly, self-regulation appears to be an important predictor of success in life. People with good self-regulation have been shown to be more popular and have better, more stable relationships, to get better grades in school and college, to have fewer personal pathologies, and to have better adjustment.
[p.843]
Self-regulation is also a key to moral behavior, and some theorists have argued that it is the master virtue that underlies most or all virtuous behavior because such behavior typically requires overcoming an anti-social or immoral impulse (e.g., to cheat, harm, or betray someone) to do what is morally valued.

- Standard and Goals
Effective self-regulation requires standards, which are concepts of how something ideally should be. Researchers on self-awareness noted very early that when people reflect on themselves, they do not simply notice how they are. Rather, they compare how they are with some standard, such as their personal ideals, other people's expectations, how they were previously, or the average person. Self-regulation begins by noting discrepancies between how you are and how you want to be. For example, a diet often begins by noting that the person weighs more than his or her ideal weight, and the diet is intended to bring the weight down to the desired weight (the standard).
Self-regulation can be impaired if standards conflict, such as if two parents make inconsistent demands on the child. A lack of clear standards also makes self-regulation difficult.
Self-regulation goals can be sorted into prevention and promotion. Preventive self-regulation focuses on some undesirable outcome and seeks to avoid it. In constrast, promotional self-regulation focuses on some desirable outcome and seeks to approach it. A related distinction is between ideal and ought standards. Ideals are positive concepts of how one would like to be. Ought standards, such as moral rules, typically emphasize some bad or undesired possibility and center on the importance of not performing such actions. 
Standards do not automatically activate self-regulation. People must be motivated to change. How people choose their goals and standards, and why they sometimes abandon these, is an important topic for further study.

- Monitoring and Feedback Loops
Monitoring refers to keeping track of particular behaviors. It is almost impossible to regulate a behavior effectively without monitoring it. (Imagine trying to have a successful diet without ever weighing yourself or keeping track of what you eat.) As stated earlier, many experts believe that a main functional purpose of self-awareness is to serve self-regulation by enabling people to monitor their behavior. Monitoring is more than noticing the behavior itself, though, because it also compares the behavior to standards.
Poor monitoring is an important cause of self-regulation failure. People lose control when they stop keeping track of their behavior. Alcohol intoxication leads to many kinds of self-regulation failure (including overeating, violent activity, overspending, and further drinking), partly because intoxicated people cease to monitor their actions. In contrast, the simplest way to improve self-regulation is to improve monitoring, such as by using external records. For example, people who want to control their spending can often benefit by keeping a written record of each time they spend money.
Self-regulation theory has incorporated the concept of feedback loops from cybernetic theory (that is, a theory originally designed for guided missiles and other mechanical control devices). The feedback loop is represented by the acronym TOTE, which stands for test, operate, test, exit. One commonly invoked example is the themostat that controls indoor room temperature. The test phase compares the present status with the standard (thus, is the room as warm as the temperature setting?). If there is a discrepancy, then the operate phase begins, which initiates some effort to resolve the problem and bring the reality in line with the standard, just as a themostat will turn on the furnace to heat the room when it is too cold. As the operate phase continues, additional tests are performed. These will indicate whether progress is being made and, if so, whether the goal or standard has been reached. As long as the reality is still short of the standard, the operations are continued. At some point, the reality reaches the standard, and the test will reveal this. There is then no need for further operations, and the loop is exited (the exit phase).
Unlike machines, humans often feel emotions during self-regulation. Noticing a discrepancy between self and standard can produce negative emotions, such as guilt or sadness or disappointment. Reaching a goal or standard after a successful operate phase can produce positive emotions such as joy, satisfaction, and relief. However, it is not necessary to reach the goal entirely to feel good. Many people experience positive emotions simply because they note that they are making progress toward the standard. In these ways, emotions can sustain and promote effective self-regulation.
[p.844]

- Strengths and Depletion
Successful self-regulation depends on the capacity to bring about the desired changes. It is not enough to have goals or standards and to keep track of behavior, if one lacks the willpower or other capacity to make the necessary changes. Some people knowingly do things that are bad for them or that violate their values.
As the colloquial term willpower implies, the capacity to regulate oneself seems to depend on a psychological resource that operates like strength or energy. Exerting self-regulation uses up some of this resource, leaving the person in a weakened state called ego depletion. In that state, people tend to be less effective at further acts of self-control. Moreover, the same resource is used for many different kinds of self-regulation and even for making difficult decisions. For example, when a person is using self-regulation to try to cope with stress or meet deadlines, there will be less available for regulating other habits, and the person may resume smoking or have atypical emotional outbursts. Some evidence indicates that strength can be increased with regular exercise (just like with a normal muscle). That is, if people regularly perform acts of self-regulation, such as trying to maintain good posture or speaking carefully, their capacity for successful self-regulation in other spheres may improve.

- Trait Differences
Different people are successful at self-regulation to different degrees, though each person's ability to self-regulate may fluctuate across time and circumstances. Some research has shown that children who were more successful at a delay of gratification task at age 4 years grew up to be more successful academically and socially, and this suggests that there is an important element of stability in people's self-regulation. (That is, if someone is good at self-regulation early in life, he or she is likely to remain good at it for many years.)
June Tangney and colleagues have reviewed some of the scales designed to measure the capacity for self-regulation. It does appear to be quite possible to rely on a self-report measure to distinguish people by how good at self-regulation they are, although some responses may be tainted by boastfulness, self-report bias, and social desirability bias.

- Other issues
Although self-regulation offers human beings a powerful psychological tool for controlling and altering their responses, its effectiveness has important limits. As already noted, consecutive efforts at self-regulation can deplete the capability for further regulation. Another important limit is that not all behaviors can be regulated. Many responses are automatic or otherwise strongly activated. The popular term impluse control (referring to self-regulation of impulsive behaviors such as alcohol and substance abuse, or violence, or sex, or eating) may be a misnomer because usually the impulse itself is not controlled but only the behavior stemming from it. That is, a reformed smoker usually cannot refrain from wanting a cigarette and has to be content refrain from wanting a cigarette and has to be content with refusing to act on that impulse and to smoke.
Controlling emotions, or affect regulation, is an important category of self-regulation thatn confronts limited power. Most people cannot alter their emotional states simply by deciding to do so. Put another way, emotions tend to be beyond conscious control. Affect regulation typically proceeds by indirect means, such as by distracting oneself, inducing a different emotion, or calming oneself down.
An ongoing debate concerns the extent to which self-regulation failure stems from irresistible impulses, rather than simply acquiescing. Many people say that they couldn't resist, such as when they spent too much money shopping or ate something fattening (or indeed engaged in proscribed acts of sex or violence). However, some research suggests that people could resist most of the time if they were sufficiently motivated. Self-deception may be involved in the process by which people allow themselves to fail at self-regulation. Undoubtedly, however, there are some irresistible impulses, such as to breathe, or go to sleep, or urinate.
Once self-regulation begins to break down, additional psychological processes may accelerate the failure. These have been called lapse-activated patterns or, in the case of alcohol and drug abuse, abstinence violation effects. A recovering alcoholic may be very careful and scrupulous about avoiding all alcohol, but after taking a drink or two on one occasion may cease to keep track and hence drink more, or may even decide that because the zero-tolerance pattern has been broken, he or she might as well enjoy more. Dieters seem particularly vulnerable to the fallacy that if a caloric indulgence has spiled one's diet for the day, one might as well eat more forbidden foods and then resume the diet tomorrow. Such spiraling process can turn a minor failure at self-regulation into a destructive binge.

abstract = {Video popularity prediction plays a foundational role in many aspects of life, such as recommendation systems and invest- ment consulting. Because of its technological and economic importance, this problem has been extensively studied for years. However, four constraints have limited most related works' usability. First, most feature oriented models are inadequate in the social media environment, because many videos are published with no specific content features, such as a strong cast or a famous script. Second, many studies assume that there is a linear correlation existing between view counts from early and later days, but this is not the case in every scenario. Third, numerous works just take view counts into consideration, but discount associated sen- timents. Nevertheless, it is the public opinions that directly drive a video's final success/failure. Also, many related ap- proaches rely on a network topology, but such topologies are unavailable in many situations. Here, we propose a Dual Sentimental Hawkes Process (DSHP) to cope with all the problems above. DSHP's innovations are reflected in three ways: (1) it breaks the ”Linear Correlation” assumption, and implements Hawkes Process; (2) it reveals deeper fac- tors that affect a video's popularity; and (3) it is topology free. We evaluate DSHP on four types of videos: Movies, TV Episodes, Music Videos, and Online News, and compare its performance against 6 widely used models, including Trans- lation Model, Multiple Linear Regression, KNN Regression, ARMA, Reinforced Poisson Process, and Univariate Hawkes Process. Our model outperforms all of the others, which in- dicates a promising application prospect.},

During its extended developmental course, metacognition becomes more explicit, powerful, and effective, as it comes to operate increasingly under the individual's conscious control. Enhancing (1) metacognitive awareness of what one believes and how one knows and (2) metastrategic control in application of the strategies that process new information is an important developmental and educational goal.

@article{Balluerka2005,
abstract = {Null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) is one of the most widely used methods for testing hypotheses in psychological research. However, it has remained shrouded in controversy throughout the almost seventy years of its existence. The present article reviews both the main criticisms of the method as well as the alternatives which have been put forward to complement or replace it. It focuses basically on those alternatives whose use is recommended by the Task Force on Statistical Inference (TFSI) of the APA (Wilkinson and TFSI, 1999) in the interests of improving the working methods of researchers with respect to statistical analysis and data interpretation. In addition, the arguments used to reject each of the criticisms levelled against NHST are reviewed and the main problems with each of the alternatives are pointed out. It is concluded that rigorous research activity requires use of NHST in the appropriate context, the complementary use of other methods which provide information about aspects not addressed by NHST, and adherence to a series of recommendations which promote its rational use in psychological research.

In this paper, we show how we create a high-quality, moderate-sized emotion lexicon using Mechanical Turk. In addition to questions about emotions evoked by terms, we show how the inclusion of a word choice question can discourage malicious data entry, help identify instances where the annotator may not be familiar with the target term (allowing us to reject such annotations), and help obtain annotations at sense level (rather than at word level). We perform an extensive analysis of the annotations to better understand the distribution of emotions evoked by terms of different parts of speech. We identify which emotions tend to be evoked simultaneously by the same term and show that certain emotions indeed go hand in hand.},

The third and final part of the manuscript introduces an overview of novel mood-regulation strategies, and explores how these strategies can inspire design interventions. Twenty activity-based opportunities to design for mood regulation are grouped into three main focal categories: seeking relief, restoring balance, and building resilience.},

In doing so, three primary criticisms were presented: (a) that control theory, as originally formulated, does not adequately describe human behavior, (b) that modifications of control theory to describe human behavior have not been successful, and (c) that the use of logical deductions to develop a control theory model of work motivation is less efficacious than a grounded theory approach. In this reply, it will be shown that (a) the first criticism is not incorrect but is an inappropriate basis for criticism, (b) statements regarding modified control theory models are either inaccurate or premature, and (c) both inductive and deductive reasoning play an important role in theory development. In addressing these issues and in discussing the distinct advantages of current control theory models it will be shown that control theory does provide a viable paradigm for understanding work motivation.

Psychologists typically rely on self-report data when quantifying mobile phone usage, despite little evidence of its validity. In this paper we explore the accuracy of using self-reported estimates when compared with actual smartphone use. We also include source code to process and visualise these data. We compared 23 participants' actual smartphone use over a two-week period with self-reported estimates and the Mobile Phone Problem Use Scale. Our results indicate that estimated time spent using a smartphone may be an adequate measure of use, unless a greater resolution of data are required. Estimates concerning the number of times an individual used their phone across a typical day did not correlate with actual smartphone use. Neither estimated duration nor number of uses correlated with the Mobile Phone Problem Use Scale. We conclude that estimated smartphone use should be interpreted with caution in psychological research.},

They used reproductions of cubist pictures of different abstractness as stimuli, which was assumed to modulate processing fluency. As a result, less abstract pictures were not only processed more fluently and preferred, they also produced larger PDs than more abstract ones. This was interpreted as support of their hypothesis. The aim of the present study was to replicate and generalize these results with an improved method and by adding expressionist pictures, which covered a relatively large range of abstractness. In the first experiment, where art style was blocked, there were no clear results. Therefore, the authors randomized art style in the second experiment. This time PDs increased with decreasing abstractness, even though significantly only for the expressionist pictures. However, there was no relation between preference and PDs. Thus, although they also observed a covariation between abstractness and pupil size, the data do not support the idea that PDs reflect fluency-induced aesthetic affect.},

In a post-scan rating they rated each item for familiarity and beauty. These individual ratings were correlated with the functional data to investigate the neural correlates of implicit aesthetic judgments. We identified clusters in which BOLD activity was correlated with individual post-scan beauty ratings. This indicates that some spontaneous aesthetic evaluation takes place during reading, even if not required by the task. Positive correlations were found in the ventral striatum and in medial prefrontal cortex, likely reflecting the rewarding nature of sentences that are aesthetically pleasing. On the contrary, negative correlations were observed in the classic left frontotemporal reading network. Midline structures and bilateral temporo-parietal regions correlated positively with familiarity, suggesting a shift from the task-network towards the default network with increasing familiarity. {\textcopyright}2012 Elsevier Inc.},

We apply the method to both photographic and non-photo-realistic (artwork) synthesis tasks. The MRF regularizer prevents over-excitation artifacts and reduces implausible feature mixtures common to previous dCNN inversion approaches, permitting synthezing photographic content with increased visual plausibility. Unlike standard MRF-based texture synthesis, the combined system can both match and adapt local features with considerable variability, yielding results far out of reach of classic generative MRF methods.},

Drawing from the Construal Level Theory and self-enhancement literatures, we hypothesized and found across three experiments that predictions of one's self in the distant future are more positive than predictions of one's self in the near future. Furthermore, building upon literature on the existence of normative and culturally sanctioned implicit theories of positive growth throughout the life span, we hypothesized and found that increased temporal distance yielded less variable predictions of affect, traits, and self-narratives (all three experiments) and that higher-level attributions mediated the effect of temporal perspective on the positivity of self-narratives (Experiment 3) and that time distance leads to more positive and less variable future selves. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Introduction: Smartphones are ubiquitous in the digital society. Although this powerful device is useful because it supports and simplifies many tasks in everyday life, a growing number of researchers is concerned that smartphones might have detrimental effects on the human brain and related psychological processes. Evidence indicates that social media platforms such as WhatsApp and Facebook are essential drivers of smartphone usage. Thus, a critical, yet unexplored issue is how excessive use of those platforms is related to Smartphone Use Disorder (SUD). Furthermore, since the roles of life satisfaction and fear of missing out (FoMo) have been demonstrated to be of particular importance for Internet Use and Internet Communication Disorder, those constructs were examined in the context of SUD. Methods: In total, n = 2299 participants filled in questionnaires assessing SUD, WhatsApp and Facebook Use Disorder, FoMO, life satisfaction, and reported owning a WhatsApp and Facebook account. Results: The study revealed that SUD was linked to WhatsApp Use Disorder, and to a lesser extent, to Facebook Use Disorder. Associations between SUD and WhatsApp Use Disorder were most strongly pronounced in females. Additionally, FoMo predicted SUD, WhatsApp, Facebook Use Disorder, and (fully) mediated the relationship between life satisfaction and those variables. Conclusion: The findings of the present study suggest that WhatsApp use plays an important role to understand SUD. Regarding the mediating role of FoMO, the present work might help disentangle inconsistent results on the link between life satisfaction and (excessive) social networking sites use.},

A key factor in design and analysis of empirical studies is characterization and measurement of ideation effectiveness. This paper describes four objective measures of ideation effectiveness. The theoretical basis of each is discussed and procedures for application of each are outlined and illustrated with case studies.},

abstract = {Given the increased awareness of the negative effects the building industry has on the environment, designs produced without considering sustainability of the planet can no longer be accepted. Although the concepts of sustainability and environmental responsibility are not new to the field of interior design, a review of the literature reveals that Environmentally Responsible Design (ERD) is not being practised with any industry-wide consistency. This article proposes an interdisciplinary pedagogical model that promises to educate students to imbed ERD principles into the design process. The TIER Model's framework is an amalgam that harnesses insights from Humanistic Sustainability, Place-Conscious Education, Principles of Sustainable Design, Phases of the Design Process and Traditional Ecological Knowledge to form a broader view of the environment and help synthesise and inculcate the concepts of sustainability. A descriptive case study illustrates how such a framework may be used to introduce ERD and sustainability concepts into design curricula. Findings from this research suggest the need to replicate the TIER Model's use within different team structures, courses and settings around the world. This work represents an innovative approach to fostering an individualised comprehension, connection and commitment to ERD among students of interior design. {\textcopyright} 2015 NSEAD/John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

abstract = {Although neuroticism has been central to most theories of personality, self-reported neuroticism has had limited success in predicting expected behavioral outcomes. The reason for this may be due, in part, to the imprecision of self-reports. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between neural correlates of control systems and neuroticism, extraversion, and self-consciousness. In response to an oddball task, neuroticism was associated with increased dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) reactivity, typically associated with discrepancy detection, whereas extraversion and self-consciousness were associated with lateral and medial frontoparietal networks, respectively, typically associated with task-focused (lateral) or self-focused (medial) controlled processes. We also examined whether the neural measure of neuroticism would predict a relevant behavioral outcome better than self-reports would. Interoceptive accuracy, an outcome associated with neuroticism, was better accounted for by dACC reactivity (r2 = .74) than by self-reported neuroticism (r2 = .16), suggesting that neural reactivities may provide a more direct measure of personality than self-reports do.},

abstract = {We describe a neural network-based system for text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis that is able to generate speech audio in the voice of many different speakers, including those unseen during training. Our system consists of three independently trained components: (1) a speaker encoder network, trained on a speaker verification task using an independent dataset of noisy speech from thousands of speakers without transcripts, to generate a fixed-dimensional embedding vector from seconds of reference speech from a target speaker; (2) a sequence-to-sequence synthesis network based on Tacotron 2, which generates a mel spectrogram from text, conditioned on the speaker embedding; (3) an auto-regressive WaveNet-based vocoder that converts the mel spectrogram into a sequence of time domain waveform samples. We demonstrate that the proposed model is able to transfer the knowledge of speaker variability learned by the discriminatively-trained speaker encoder to the new task, and is able to synthesize natural speech from speakers that were not seen during training. We quantify the importance of training the speaker encoder on a large and diverse speaker set in order to obtain the best generalization performance. Finally, we show that randomly sampled speaker embeddings can be used to synthesize speech in the voice of novel speakers dissimilar from those used in training, indicating that the model has learned a high quality speaker representation.},

abstract = {A growing body of literature demonstrates that smartphone use can become problematic when individuals develop a technology dependency such that fear can result. This fear is often referred to as Nomophobia, denoting the fear of not being able to use one's phone. While the literature (especially on technostress and problematic smartphone use) has shed ample light on the question of which factors contribute to the development of Nomophobia, it remains less clear how, why, and under what conditions Nomophobia, in turn, results in negative consequences, especially stress. Drawing on the demand-control-person model, this study develops a novel research model indicating that Nomophobia impacts stress through the perception of a social threat and that this indirect effect depends on the context of a phone withdrawal situation. Data collected from 270 smartphone users and analyzed using multi-group path analysis supported our model. The results showed that the proposed indirect effect is non-significant only when situational certainty and controllability come together, that is, when people know for how long they will not be able to use their phones and when they have control over the situation. Managers can help their nomophobic employees by instilling in them trust and perceptions of social presence while also giving them more control over their smartphone use during meetings.},

abstract = {Despite its centrality to human thought and practice, aesthetics has for the most part played a petty role in human-computer interaction research. Increasingly, however, researchers attempt to strike a balance between the traditional concerns of human-computer interaction and considerations of aesthetics. Thus, recent research suggests that the visual aesthetics of computer interfaces is a strong determinant of users' satisfaction and pleasure. However, the lack of appropriate concepts and measures of aesthetics may severely constraint future research in this area. To address this issue, we conducted four studies in order to develop a measurement instrument of perceived web site aesthetics. Using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses we found that users' perceptions consists of two main dimensions, which we termed "classical aesthetics" and "expressive aesthetics". The classical aesthetics dimension pertains to aesthetic notions that presided from antiquity until the 18th century. These notions emphasize orderly and clear design and are closely related to many of the design rules advocated by usability experts. The expressive aesthetics dimension is manifested by the designers' creativity and originality and by the ability to break design conventions. While both dimensions of perceived aesthetic are drawn from a pool of aesthetic judgments, they are clearly distinguishable from each other. Each of the aesthetic dimensions is measured by a five-item scale. The reliabilities, factor structure and validity tests indicate that these items reflect the two perceived aesthetics dimensions adequately. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In the field of design, using artifacts in creative ways other than the ways envisioned by their designers has been regarded as merely a form of “use,” rather than a creative activity in its own right. This study reconceives everyday design as a process by which people create new uses for designed artifacts within given contexts. We enlisted four groups of professional designers into a practical design experiment. Two groups were provided with everyday design cases collected from a sharing application, Wikiuse, while the other two were provided with related design cases. The everyday design cases were found to encourage a design process that is strongly interaction-oriented. An “interaction-oriented process” is a design process that starts with recognition of non-intrusive, everyday actions inherent in everyday design cases, actions that are then incorporated into design solutions. Moreover, professional designers learn how such actions are achieved with everyday artifacts via everyday design cases, which consist of artifact–interaction pairs. Designers can thus reach a design solution by adopting interactions from everyday design cases. This process obviates the need for designers to represent the context of product use in their design processes, as professional designers who utilize everyday design cases are already heavily immersed in the actual context.},

Our approach draws on existing literature to investigate the creativity and idea generation process within the frame of multisectoral and multidisciplinary cooperation initiatives, involving firms and Science and Technology related institutions. We then call upon our own empirical work to identify conditions favourable to those processes and some issues that affect the fulfilment of the creative potential that exists in multidisciplinary groups.

abstract = {A meta-analysis of 797 studies and 1,001 effect sizes tested a theoretical hypothesis that situational constraints, such as perceived social pressure and perceived difficulty, weaken the relationship between attitudes and behavior. This hypothesis was confirmed for attitudes toward performing behaviors and for attitudes toward issues and social groups. Meta-analytic estimates of attitude– behavior correlations served to quantify these moderating effects. The present results indicated that the mean attitude– behavior correlation was .41 when people experienced a mean level of social pressure to perform a behavior of mean difficulty. The mean correlation was .30 when people experienced social pressure 1 standard deviation above the mean to perform a behavior that was 1 standard deviation more difficult than the mean. The results suggest a need for increased attention to the “behavior” side of the attitude– behavior equation. Attitudes predict some behaviors better than others.},

To bring needed attention to the subject of product design and enable researchers to better investigate design issues, the author introduces a conceptual model and several propositions that describe how the form of a product relates to consumers' psychological and behavioral responses. After presenting this model, the author describes numerous strategic implications and research directions.},

We found that when participants learned object structure by actively rotating the objects, the objects were recognized faster during a subsequent recognition task than when object structure was learned through passive observation. We also found that participants focused their study time during active ex- ploration on a limited number of object views, while ignoring other views. Overall, our results suggest that allowing active exploration of an object during initial learning can facilitate recognition of that ob- ject, perhaps owing to the control that the participant has over the object views upon which they can focus. The virtual reality environment is ideal for studying such processes, allowing realistic interaction with objects while maintaining experimenter control.},

p. 557 the essence of path analysis is...
{\{}{\&}{\}}quot;
the combination of knowledge of the degrees of correlation among the variables in a system with such knowledge as may be possessed of the causal relations. 
In cases in which the causal relations are uncertain the method can be used to find the logical consequences of any particurlar hypothesis in regard to them.
{\{}{\&}{\}}quot;
(in: Structural equation modeling By Bruce H. Pugesek, Adrian Tomer, Alexander von Eye)
The specification of a complete causal diagram is, therefore, essential to the method. Tied to such a specification, path coefficients can be defiend as numbers by which variables have to be multiplied to express one variable as a linear function of other variables.

Another brief question:

Another difference between the early Sewell Wright approach
and modern SEM is that Wright's models were, I believe, just-
identified or deterministic. There were k equations in k
unknowns. The question is, if this is so, and I think it is,
who was the first to use overidentified models and fit statistics?

Clearly the terms {\{}{\&}{\}}quot;path analysis{\{}{\&}{\}}quot; and {\{}{\&}{\}}quot;path coefficients{\{}{\&}{\}}quot; came
from the early (circa 1920) work of Sewell Wright. I believe that
since Wright dealt mostly with standardized estimates (which
simplified certain algebraic steps), {\{}{\&}{\}}quot;path analysis{\{}{\&}{\}}quot; came to mean
causal models with standardized estimates.
I don't know if he was the first, but in Duncan's 1975 book
({\{}{\_}{\}}Introduction to Structural Equation Models{\{}{\_}{\}}) he argues that
{\{}{\&}{\}}quot;it would probably be salutary if research workers relinquished
the habit of expressing variables in standard form{\{}{\&}{\}}quot; (p. 51).
He goes on to say, {\{}{\&}{\}}quot;Clearly, it is possible to solve uniquely for
the b's, which we shall term the structural coefficients{\{}{\&}{\}}quot; (p. 53).
After that, I believe it just evolved into {\{}{\&}{\}}quot;structural
modeling,{\{}{\&}{\}}quot; and {\{}{\&}{\}}quot;structural equation modeling,{\{}{\&}{\}}quot; which later
encompassed models that also included latent, unmeasured variables.

*********************************************************************
I believe that the first time Sewell Wright used the phrase
{\{}{\&}{\}}quot;path analysis{\{}{\&}{\}}quot; was in 1920 (Sewell Wright (1920). The relative
importance of heredity and environment in determining the birth
weight of guinea pigs. {\{}{\_}{\}}Proceedings of the National Academy
of Sciences{\{}{\_}{\}}, {\{}{\_}{\}}6{\{}{\_}{\}}, 320-332.). The standardized structual
coefficients in that model he called {\{}{\&}{\}}quot;path coefficients.{\{}{\&}{\}}quot;

I don't know if it is the first time the phrase was used,
but Arthur S. Goldberger used the phrase {\{}{\&}{\}}quot;structural equation
models{\{}{\&}{\}}quot; in a paper published in 1972. He wrote, {\{}{\&}{\}}quot;By structural
equation models, I refer to stochastic models in which each
equation represents a causal link, rather than a mere empirical
association.{\{}{\&}{\}}quot; (Arthur S. Goldberger (1972). Structural equation
methods in the social sciences. {\{}{\_}{\}}Econometrica{\{}{\_}{\}}, {\{}{\_}{\}}40{\{}{\_}{\}}, 979-1001,
p. 979.)
I believe that the first overidentified model estimated was
Sewell Wright's model of corn and hog prices in 1925 (Sewell
Wright (1925). {\{}{\_}{\}}Corn and Hog Correlations{\{}{\_}{\}}. Washington, D.C.:
U.S. Department of Agriculture Bulletin 1300, January, 1925.)
Wright estimates a system of equations between corn crop, corn
price, the summer price of hogs, the winter price of hogs, and
the amount of hog breeding in successive years. It certainly
was overidentified! He had thirteen unknowns in 40 equations.
This was long before {\{}{\&}{\}}quot;fit{\{}{\&}{\}}quot; statistics, so Wright used an ad hoc
procedure to estimate the unknowns that would satisfy as many
of the estimating equations as possible.
This model was also, as far as I know, the first to use
unmeasured variables in causal models, as the hog-breeding
variable was unmeasured.
In this same paper, Wright remarked in a footnote that it was
possible to consider reciprocal causal relationships in such
models, but, he wrote, {\{}{\&}{\}}quot;the treatment of such reciprocal relations
between variables requires an extension of the theory of path
coefficients.{\{}{\&}{\}}quot;
Three years later, Wright addressed this issue in an appendix
to a book by his father (Phillip G. Wright (1928). {\{}{\_}{\}}The Tariff on
Animal and Vegetable Oils{\{}{\_}{\}}. New York: Macmillan.) The appendix
addressed the problem of identifiability in supply-demand models.

abstract = {Australian universities recently received a list of journals from the Australian Research Council (ARC). This list was the proposed set of journal rankings for the new Excellence in Research for Australia (ERA) initiative. This list includes journals for design and design research. Few design research journals appear on the list, and moist of those few have low rankings. The ERA journal-ranking proposal is intended to cover all appropriate journals across all fields. Journal rankings for any specific field should represent an appropriate distribution of journals for that field. Journals are described as A* journals representing the top 5{\%} of journals in a field, A journals representing the next 15{\%}, B journals representing the next 20{\%}, and C journals for all the rest. The political and financial importance of the ranking system is one aspect of the new government's move from the former Research Quality Framework (RQF) to the new metric assessment system developed for the ERA. We identified several problems in reviewing the proposed list. Some problems affect the field of design and design research. Other problems affect all sectors. To examine some of these problems, we will refer to the results of our study. We therefore outline our study before going further. To identify appropriate journals for the design sector, we conducted a worldwide study by inviting leading scholars in design and design research to list leading journals in the field. Our next study will use several comparative methods to measure the validity of this first study and to draw on a larger sample with more definitive results. We hope to develop a more fine-grained analysis to answer questions we do not address here. We are completing this study in the time required to meet ARC response deadlines. This the first study of its kind in the field, based on a large and reliable sample. The titles are well known. The reputations, impact factors, and index standing of the top journals supports our results. Based on responses to the survey, the journals that we will recommend for the levels designated A*, A, and B follow.},

McCrae's (1992b) 5-factor model, the authors found that Neuroticism and Extraversion correlated significantly with national SWB. Lie scale scores were also related strongly to national SWB. Neuroticism and Extraversion incrementally predicted SWB above gross national product per capita. The strength of these results indicates that personality can have stronger relationships at national levels of analysis than at the individual level. National personality traits appear to be unwisely neglected, having considerable but largely unconsidered explanatory power.},

Nevertheless, emerging sources of optimism exist regarding the possibility of permanent increases in happiness. Drawing on the past well-being literature, the authors propose that a person's chronic happiness level is governed by 3 major factors: a genetically determined set point for happiness, happiness-relevant circumstantial factors, and happiness-relevant activities and practices. The authors then consider adaptation and dynamic processes to show why the activity category offers the best opportunities for sustainably increasing happiness. Finally, existing research is discussed in support of the model, including 2 preliminary happiness-increasing interventions.},

abstract = { Economists consider information a paradoxical good of uncertain value. This experimental study compares the valuation of economic information to the valuation of material goods when subjects possess perfect information so that uncertainty about the outcome of the transaction is eliminated. It also aims to study the participants' justifications of their valuations, in order to examine the underlying cognitive processes. The main hypotheses were that: (a) even if subjects deal with perfect information they will underestimate its value compared to the value of material goods; (b) underestimation of the value of information will be greater in conditions of high involvement, that is when expected payoff and therefore investment and risk are high; and (c) expert information will be valued more highly than non-expert information, since it should be regarded as more reliable. In the main study, two groups of students in the same university were asked to value and justify their valuation of material goods, under conditions of certain low (1000) and high (100,000) payoffs, respectively. Two other groups were asked to value and to justify their valuation of non-expert information under the same conditions of profit. Finally, two more groups of students were asked to value and justify their valuation of expert information, again under conditions of low or high expected profit. The findings of the study show that under all conditions subjects underestimate the value of information both absolutely and relatively in comparison to material goods, especially under conditions of high involvement. The participants' justifications of their own valuations are heuristics which seem to take into account the uncertain character of informational goods. },

abstract = {The innovative impact of technical products strongly depends on the ways of proceeding in the early phases of engineering design. Within a quasi-experimental randomised control group design including 95 engineering design students forming 21 groups, we analysed whether offering a system of generic cognitive strategies in addition to the regular curriculum in engineering design methodology may significantly improve engineering students' knowledge, ways of proceeding, and performance. The additionally provided strategies are associated with a significantly larger increase of reported knowledge on generic cognitive techniques and strategies utilised by a greater proportion of teams assigned to the experimental group. These results suggest integrating generic cognitive strategies into the regular engineering design curriculum. {\textcopyright} 2015 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper aims at highlighting the importance for learning of one of the facets of metacognition, namely metacognitive experiences (ME) that comprise feelings, judgments or estimates, and online task-specific knowledge. The emphasis is on the affective character of ME, which has received little attention in the past. Unlike online task-specific knowledge, which is conscious and analytic, the other ME are products of nonconscious, nonanalytic inferential processes. Because of their nature, ME can trigger either rapid, nonconscious control decisions or conscious analytic ones. However, ME can make use of both the affective and the cognitive regulatory loops, and this has a series of implications for learning. Evidence is presented regarding the relations of ME with affect and cognition, and the implications of the lack of accuracy of ME for the self-regulation of learning. Particular emphasis is given on judgment of learning, feeling of difficulty, and feeling of confidence. The challenges for future research on metacognition are underscored.},

Despite much effort that has been put into understanding the mechanisms of the addictive process, treatment strategies have remained suboptimal over the past several decades. Mindfulness training, which is based on ancient Buddhist models of human suffering, has recently shown preliminary efficacy in treating addictions. These early models show remarkable similarity to current models of the addictive process, especially in their overlap with operant conditioning (positive and negative reinforcement). Further, they may provide explanatory power for the mechanisms of mindfulness training, including its effects on core addictive elements, such as craving, and the underlying neurobiological processes that may be active therein. In this review, using smoking as an example, we will highlight similarities between ancient and modern views of the addictive process, review studies of mindfulness training for addictions and their effects on craving and other components of this process, and discuss recent neuroimaging findings that may inform our understanding of the neural mechanisms of mindfulness training.},

We followed the Demsar analysis and found that the three best classifiers (random forest, gbm and RBF SVM) are not significantly different from each other. We also discuss that a change of less then 0.0112 in the error rate should be considered as an irrelevant change, and used a Bayesian ANOVA analysis to conclude that with high probability the differences between these three classifiers is not of practical consequence. We also verified the execution time of "standard implementations" of these algorithms and concluded that RBF SVM is the fastest (significantly so) both in training time and in training plus testing time.},

Effect sizes overall revealed that positive moods produce more creativity than mood-neutral controls (r  .15), but no significant differences between negative moods and mood-neutral controls (r.03) or between positive and negative moods (r.04) were observed. Creativity is enhanced most by positive mood states that are activating and associated with an approach motivation and promotion focus (e.g., happiness), rather than those that are deactivating and associated with an avoidance motivation and prevention focus (e.g., relaxed). Negative, deactivating moods with an approach moti- vation and a promotion focus (e.g., sadness) were not associated with creativity, but negative, activating moods with an avoidance motivation and a prevention focus (fear, anxiety) were associated with lower creativity, especially when assessed as cognitive flexibility. With a few exceptions, these results generalized across experimental and correlational designs, populations (students vs. general adult population), and facet of creativity (e.g., fluency, flexibility, originality, eureka/insight). The authors discuss theoretical implications and highlight avenues for future research on specific moods, creativity, and their relationships.},

abstract = {The rapid growth of social networks has produced an unprecedented amount of user-generated data, which provides an excellent opportunity for text mining. Sentiment analysis, an important part of text mining, attempts to learn about the authors' opinion on a text through its content and structure. Such information is particularly valuable for determining the overall opinion of a large number of people. Examples of the usefulness of this are predicting box office sales or stock prices. One of the most accessible sources of user-generated data is Twitter, which makes the majority of its user data freely available through its data access API. In this study we seek to predict a sentiment value for stock related tweets on Twitter, and demonstrate a correlation between this sentiment and the movement of a company's stock price in a real time streaming environment. Both n-gram and “word2vec” textual representation techniques are used alongside a random forest classification algorithm to predict the sentiment of tweets. These values are then evaluated for correlation between stock prices and Twitter sentiment for that each company. There are significant correlations between price and sentiment for several individual companies. Some companies such as Microsoft and Walmart show strong positive correlation, while others such as Goldman Sachs and Cisco Systems show strong negative correlation. This suggests that consumer facing companies are affected differently than other companies. Overall this appears to be a promising field for future research.},

Number of publications propose strategies with good profits, while others demonstrate the random and unpredictable behaviour of share prices. Shared prices aren't really based on how a company works. It's based on how mass psychology works. Sentiment Analysis is one of the most popular technique which is widely been used in every industry. Extraction of sentiments from user's comments is used in detecting the user view for a particular company. Sentiment Analysis can help in predicting the mood of people which affects the stock prices and thus can help in prediction of actual prices. Stock market prediction is the act of trying to determine the future value or other financial instrument traded on a financial exchange. In this paper, project is overall based upon the myriad data which is going to be mined from various stock related portals, social media, etc. and after fetching the desired data they have been used for the predictions of related results using NB classifier (Naive Bayes classifier).},

abstract = {Innovation is important for successful designs, but design fixation likely prevents designers from reaching their innovative potential. Participants in this study were 120 students, 80 of which had design backgrounds. Participants saw an example tool, and then worked alone or in small groups to design two new tools using a construction set. All participants designed two tools: one in a physical prototyping environment and one in an environment without physical prototyping. Results showed that designs were better and contained fewer fixations to the example tool when designed in the physical prototyping environment, but that groups designed better tools than individuals or nominal groups when no physical prototyping was available. These results underscore the importance of physical prototyping in design. {\textcopyright}2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The present study tested the effects of a time perspective intervention designed to increase an individual's orientation to the future. Because a future orientation constitutes a fundamental dimension in career choice attitudes and competencies, the intervention should, in addition to increasing future orientation, foster career development. Accordingly, the outcome measures addressed both future orientation (i.e., temporal continuity and optimism about the achievability of future goals) and career planning (i.e., planful attitudes and planning outcomes). The intervention was administered, separately, to two groups of tenth-grade students and two groups of college freshmen. The experimental groups, when compared to control groups, exhibited statistically significant increases in future orientation as they improved their sense of continuity between the past, present, and future and enhanced their optimism about the future. The intervention produced its largest effect size (.77) for more highly developed attitudes toward career planning among the experimental group. The intervention, however, did not immediately affect the quality of the students' planning outcomes.},

(1) How can we discover creative promise in our children and our youth, (2) How can we promote the development of creative personalities. Creative talent cannot be accounted for adequately in terms of I.Q. A new way of thinking about creativity and creative productivity is seen in the factorial conceptions of personality. By application of factor analysis a fruitful exploratory approach can be made. Carefully constructed hypotheses concerning primary abilities will lead to the use of novel types of tests. New factors will be discovered that will provide us with means to select individuals with creative personalities. The properties of primary abilities should be studied to improve educational methods and further their utilization.},

Hierarchical regression analysis showed that self-esteem moderated the association between extraversion and subjective well-being. Among students high in self-esteem, those with high extraversion had higher subjective well-being than did those with low extraversion. Across all participants (high-and low-extraversion groups), subjective well-being was low when self-esteem was low. Gender moderated the link between extraversion and subjective well-being, tending to be a more significant determinant of subjective well-being in men than in women.},

Emergence of preferences early in development and cross-cultural agreement on attractiveness challenge a long-held view that our preferences reflect arbitrary standards of beauty set by cultures. Averageness, symmetry, and sexual dimorphism are good candidates for biologically based standards of beauty. A critical review and meta-analyses indicate that all three are attractive in both male and female faces and across cultures. Theorists have proposed that face preferences may be adaptations for mate choice because attractive traits signal important aspects of mate quality, such as health. Others have argued that they may simply be by-products of the way brains process information. Although often presented as alternatives, I argue that both kinds of selection pressures may have shaped our perceptions of facial beauty.},

abstract = {In this paper we propose a new method to get the specified network parameters through one time feed-forward propagation of the meta networks and explore the application to neural style transfer. Recent works on style transfer typically need to train image transformation networks for every new style, and the style is encoded in the network parameters by enormous iterations of stochastic gradient descent. To tackle these issues, we build a meta network which takes in the style image and produces a corresponding image transformations network directly. Compared with optimization-based methods for every style, our meta networks can handle an arbitrary new style within {\$}19ms{\$} seconds on one modern GPU card. The fast image transformation network generated by our meta network is only 449KB, which is capable of real-time executing on a mobile device. We also investigate the manifold of the style transfer networks by operating the hidden features from meta networks. Experiments have well validated the effectiveness of our method.

Results indicated that more sociable and extraverted participants tended to be more legible, that is, were judged more accurately. Participants who were more accurate judges tended to be less sociable and performed better on tests of decoding accuracy. Performance on the PONS predicted accuracy of judgment for men, whereas performance on the IPT predicted accuracy of judgment for women. On the whole, results suggest that some important and theoretically relevant moderators of accuracy in the zero-acquaintance situation have been identified.},

Today, many users of computers neither know nor wish to learn how computers operate-they merely wish to get their jobs done. In addition, vendors are under increasing pressure to develop innovative products quickly. To be innovative means to address important needs in new ways, and since existing products cannot act as models, guidance must come from users themselves. As the industry has recognized these challenges, practitioners are looking for new ways to involve the customer closely in design. This has resulted in such approaches as Joint Application Design, user-centered requirements analysis, user-centered design, and many PD techniques including contextual design. Contextual design is the approach to bringing customer data into design through a well-defined sequence of activities. The foundations for contextual design were developed in 1988.},

abstract = {A number of phenomenologic studies have demonstrated the marked heterogeneity of unipolar depressive disorders. We have recently identified a subtype of depression characterized by the presence of irritability and anger attacks. These attacks are sudden spells of anger accompanied by symptoms of autonomic activation such as tachycardia, sweating, flushing, and tightness of the chest. They are experienced by depressed patients as uncharacteristic of them and inappropriate to the situations in which they occur. Approximately one third of depressed outpatients present with anger attacks. Patients with unipolar depression and anger attacks frequently experience significant anxiety and somatic symptoms, and are relatively more likely to meet criteria for avoidant, dependent, borderline, narcissistic, and antisocial personality disorders than depressed patients without these attacks. Anger attacks subside in 53{\%} to 71{\%} of depressed outpatients treated with antidepressants, and the degree of improvement in depressive symptoms after antidepressant treatment is comparable in depressed patients with and without anger attacks. In addition, the rate of emergence of anger attacks after treatment with antidepressants (6{\%}-10{\%}) appears to be lower than the rate with placebo (20{\%}). Finally, antidepressants that affect serotonergic neurotransmission, known to be involved in the modulation of aggressive behavior in animals and humans, may be particularly effective in this subtype of depression, but further studies are needed to support this hypothesis.},

METHODS: Cyclists were assigned to an eight-week mindfulness intervention, which incorporated a mindful spin-bike training component, or a wait-list control condition. Participants completed baseline and post-test measures of mindfulness, flow, sport-anxiety, and sport-related pessimistic attributions. RESULTS: Analyses of covariance showed significant positive effects on mindfulness, flow, and pessimism for the 27 cyclists in the mindfulness intervention condition compared with the 20 cyclists in the control condition. Changes in mindfulness experienced by the intervention participants were positively associated with changes in flow. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that mindfulness-based interventions tailored to specific athletic pursuits can be effective in facilitating flow experiences.},

annote = {Note3 interpretational confounding in simultaneous estimation of structural and measurement model

In the presence of misspecification, the usual situation in
practice, a one-step approach in which the measurement and
structural submodels are estimated simultaneously will suffer
from interpretational confounding(el. Burr, 1973, 1976).

Interpretational confounding {\{}{\&}{\}}quot;occurs as the assignment of empirical
meaning to an unobserved variable which is other than the
meaning assigned to it by an individual a priori to estimating
unknown parameters{\{}{\&}{\}}quot; (Burr, 1976, p. 4). 

Furthermore, this
empirically defined meaning may change considerably, depending
on the specification of free and constrained parameters for
the structural submodel. Interpretational confounding is reflected
by marked changes in the estimates of the pattern coefficients
when alternate structural models are estimated.
The potential for interpretational confounding is minimized
by prior separate estimation of the measurement model because
no constraints are placed on the structural parameters
that relate the estimated constructs to one another. Given acceptable
unidimensional measurement, the pattern coefficients
from the measurement model should change only trivially, if at
all, when the measurement submodel and alternate structural
submodels are simultaneously estimated. With a one-step approach,
the presence of interpretational confounding may not
be detected, resulting in fit being maximized at the expense of
meaningful interpretability of the constructs.},

@article{Spehn2000,
abstract = {In Koriat's paper "The Feeling of Knowing: Some Metatheoretical Implications for Consciousness and Control," he asserts that the feeling of knowing straddles the implicit and explicit, and that these conscious feelings enter into a conscious control process that is necessary for controlled behavior. This assertion allows him to make many speculations on the nature of consciousness itself. We agree that feelings of knowing are produced through a monitoring of one's knowledge, and that this monitoring can affect the control of behavior such as whether or not to search memory for an answer. Further, we believe that monitoring of performance with a strategy can also affect cognition control and strategy selection; however, we also believe that frequently this monitoring and control occurs without conscious awareness. Feeling of knowing has received an inordinate amount of attention because it lies behind the highly recognizable tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon that represents one of the rare cases of conscious monitoring. There are other feelings of knowing which are much more common and are not accompanied by conscious awareness. These are evident in the early selection of a strategy for answering a problem. In our view, the research on feeling of knowing will not resolve the question of whether consciousness is merely epiphenomenal.},

This method allows design teams to explore possible futures with target users. Speed dating helps to reduce the risk of making things that people will not adopt.

Over the last decade, we have used this method in many research projects, teaching it to hundreds of UX design students.

No previous knowledge of research methods is assumed and the series is particularly suited to practitioners studying for a higher degree or who want to research some aspect of their practice. The thinking underlying the series reflects a major shift in social science research methods over the past fifteen years - away from a natural-sciences style which emphasizes deductive theory- testing, a prior determination of method (usually experi- mental) and 'generalizable' results, towards a recognition that such requirements are often unworkable and inap- propriate in the real world. This is not a defect, because the traditionally 'scientific' methods are often not adequate as a way of understanding how people behave 'in context'. This does not mean that one should give up an empirical, evidence-based research tradi- tion but adapt to what is possible and, more importantly, what is likely to yield a truer picture},

With contributions from renowned and promising researchers from all over the globe, and at the interface of social, personality, cognitive and clinical psychology, the handbook captures the breadth and depth of the field of psychological time. Time perspective, as the way people construe the past, the present and the future, is conceived and presented not only as one of the most influential dimensions in our psychological life leading to self-impairing behaviors, but also as a facet of our person that can be de-biased and supportive for well-being and happiness. Written in honor of Philip G. Zimbardo on his 80th birthday and in acknowledgement of his leading role in the field, the book contains illustrations of the countless studies and applications that his theory has stimulated, and captures the theoretical, methodological and practical pathways he opened by his prolific research.},

This positron emission tomography (PET) study investigated by means of a factorial design the interaction between the emotional and the perspective factors. Participants were asked to adopt either their own (first person) perspective or the (third person) perspective of their mothers in response to situations involving social emotions or to neutral situations. The main effect of third-person versus first-person perspective resulted in hemodynamic increase in the medial part of the superior frontal gyrus, the left superior temporal sulcus, the left temporal pole, the posterior cingulate gyrus, and the right inferior parietal lobe. A cluster in the postcentral gyrus was detected in the reverse comparison. The amygdala was selectively activated when subjects were processing social emotions, both related to self and other. Interaction effects were identified in the left temporal pole and in the right postcentral gyrus. These results support our prediction that the frontopolar, the somatosensory cortex, and the right inferior parietal lobe are crucial in the process of self/other distinction. In addition, this study provides important building blocks in our understanding of social emotion processing and human empathy.},

abstract = {Recognition and identification of aesthetic preference is indispensable in industrial design. Humans tend to pursue products with aesthetic values and make buying decisions based on their aesthetic preferences. The existence of neuromarketing is to understand consumer responses toward marketing stimuli by using imaging techniques and recognition of physiological parameters. Numerous studies have been done to understand the relationship between human, art and aesthetics. In this paper, we present a novel preference-based measurement of user aesthetics using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals for virtual 3D shapes with motion. The 3D shapes are designed to appear like bracelets, which is generated by using the Gielis superformula. EEG signals were collected by using a medical grade device, the B-Alert X10 from advance brain monitoring, with a sampling frequency of 256 Hz and resolution of 16 bits. The signals obtained when viewing 3D bracelet shapes were decomposed into alpha, beta, theta, gamma and delta rhythm by using time–frequency analysis, then classified into two classes, namely like and dislike by using support vector machines and K-nearest neighbors (KNN) classifiers respectively. Classification accuracy of up to 80 {\%} was obtained by using KNN with the alpha, theta and delta rhythms as the features extracted from frontal channels, Fz, F3 and F4 to classify two classes, like and dislike.},

Just like the other contender for the hot spot, sustainability, the concept is big enough and hazy enough for almost everyone to declare its importance, while attaching very different meanings to it. The broad consensus on design thinking began to break down in 2009. Some leading design thinkers published books that expanded on what they meant; business leaders started to pick up the idea, while at the same time many design managers started to drop it. This raises two questions: Why is design thinking such a hot topic with executives yet leaves so many designers cold? And, does the demand for design thinking represent more of an opportunity than the thinking itself?},

Several accounts for this effect have been offered, including ideomotor theory and a social functional perspective. The authors tested an additional perspective, the Active-Self account, whereby primes can temporarily alter self-perceptions. In Study 1, non-African American participants reported feeling more aggressive on an implicit measure following an African American prime. In Study 2, participants reported feeling luckier on an implicit measure following a number 7 (vs. 13) prime. In both studies, these effects were obtained only for low self-monitors, who are more likely to change self-conceptions in response to diagnostic self-information and to use their internal states in guiding behavior. Study 3 showed that low self-monitors also show larger behavioral effects of primes.},

While a 100-point scale is intuitive in many respects and allows for relative judgments, information describing how the numeric score translates into an absolute judgment of usability is not known. To help answer that question, a seven-point adjective-anchored Likert scale was added as an eleventh question to nearly 1,000 SUS surveys. Results show that the Likert scale scores correlate extremely well with the SUS scores (r=0.822). The addition of the adjective rating scale to the SUS may help practitioners interpret individual SUS scores and aid in explaining the results to non-human factors professionals.},

The authors propose that the ERN is generated when a negative reinforcement learning signal is conveyed to the anterior cingulate cortex via the mesencephalic dopamine system and that this signal is used by the anterior cingulate cortex to modify performance on the task at hand.

abstract = {Participatory design is not one approach but a proliferating family of design practices that hosts many design agendas and comes with a varied set of toolboxes. In this chapter we will give examples of toolboxes with the ambition to show that there is a richness of tools and techniques available that may be combined, adapted and extended to form the basis for yet new PD practices. It is shown how the making of things, the telling of stories and the enactment of possible futures together provide the basis for forming a temporary community in which the new can be envisioned. The introduction frames tools and techniques within participatory design and describes participatory design as various practices of participation. The following sections give examples of how designers and non-designers participate in PD practices through activities focusing on telling, making and enacting. The final section reflects on present and future challenges. We present a wide selection of tools and techniques for PD, describing how they ´support participants in making, telling and enacting aspects of future design. The aim is to stimulate further proliferation of formats and procedures that may bring PD to new design challenges and to new designer/user communities. Our claim is not that tools and techniques have to be applied rigorously. Instead we suggest that sensitivity to the coherence of making, telling and enacting provides sufficient grounding for designers (and non-designers) to make the tools and techniques relevant for whatever participatory action they are involved in. This includes being aware of what is accomplished as particular tools and techniques become part of specific participatory design practices. Finding out how these in combination can create formats and procedures that can create engagement, a common image of the vision or PD development task, and last but not least, create ownership for the results},

abstract = {Introduction Sustainability is rapidly becoming an issue of critical importance for designers and society as a whole. A complexity of dynamically interrelated ecological, social, cultural, economic, and psychologi-cal (awareness) problems interact and converge in the current crisis of our unsustainable civilization. However, in a constantly chang-ing environment, sustainability is not some ultimate endpoint, but instead is a continuous process of learning and adaptation. Designing for sustainability not only requires the redesign of our habits, lifestyles, and practices, but also the way we think about design. Sustainability is a process of coevolution and co-design that involves diverse communities in making flexible and adaptable design decisions on local, regional, and global scales. The transition towards sustainability is about co-creating a human civilization that flourishes within the ecological limits of the planetary life support system. Design is fundamental to all human activity. At the nexus of values, attitudes, needs, and actions, designers have the potential to act as transdisciplinary integrators and facilitators. The map of value systems and perspectives described by Beck and Cowan 1 as " Spiral Dynamics " can serve as a tool in facilitating " transdisciplinary design dialogue. " Such dialogue will help to integrate the multiple perspectives and diverse knowledge base of different disciplines, value systems, and stakeholders. Further expansion of the " integral vision " by Wilber 2 consolidates a framework for understanding, acknowledging, and weaving together different perspectives and worldviews. Esbj{\"{o}}rn-Hargens and Brown 3 describe the applica-tion of this framework to solving complex problems of local and global relevance, and to sustainable development. When applied to design, this kind of framework can help us to conceptualize how different value systems and different onto-epistemological assump-tions change our experience of reality, and therefore intentionality behind design. This change in why we design things and processes in turn affects what and how we design. Since sustainability requires widespread participation, communities everywhere need to begin to shape local, regional, and global visions of sustainability, and to offer strategies to engage humanity collectively in cooperative processes that will turn visions},

Cortical activity was assessed by means of event-related changes in EEG power (synchronization and desynchronization) and phase locking in two alpha bands. Analyses revealed that more, as compared with less, original ideas elicited a stronger event-related synchronization of alpha activity (power increases from the pre-stimulus reference to the activation interval) and higher phase coupling in the right hemisphere.

abstract = {There is increasing recognition that high self-esteem is heterogeneous. Recent research suggests that individuals who report having high self-esteem (i.e., have high explicit self-esteem) behave more defensively to the extent that they have relatively low implicit self-esteem. The current studies test whether individuals with high explicit self-esteem are more likely to discriminate ethnically, as a defensive technique, to the extent that they have relatively low implicit self-esteem. The results support this prediction. Among participants with high explicit self-esteem, all of whom were threatened by negative performance feedback, those with relatively low implicit self-esteem recommended a more severe punishment for a Native, but not a White, student who started a fist-fight. In Study 2, this pattern was not apparent for participants with relatively low explicit self-esteem.},

abstract = {Explicit self-esteem (ESE) is an important factor influencing subject well-being (SWB). However, the relationship between ESE and SWB is not clear. Due to the complex nature of self-esteem, implicit self-esteem (ISE) might moderate the relationship between ESE and SWB. Furthermore, providing the consistency between ISE and ESE, the interacting effect of ISE and ESE would only be significant for the cognitive component of SWB rather than the emotional component. To examine these assumptions, the present study recruited a total of 134 undergraduate students and measured their ISE, ESE, and SWB using Implicit Association Test (IAT) and self-report measures. The results showed that (a) ESE, rather than ISE, was significantly correlated to SWB; and (b) the interaction between ISE and ESE could significantly predict the cognitive components of SWB rather than the emotional components. Those findings contribute to the further understanding of the relationship between self-esteem and SWB.},

abstract = {Artistic style transfer is an image synthesis problem where the content of an image is reproduced with the style of another. Recent works show that a visually appealing style transfer can be achieved by using the hidden activations of a pretrained convolutional neural network. However, existing methods either apply (i) an optimization procedure that works for any style image but is very expensive, or (ii) an efficient feedforward network that only allows a limited number of trained styles. In this work we propose a simpler optimization objective based on local matching that combines the content structure and style textures in a single layer of the pretrained network. We show that our objective has desirable properties such as a simpler optimization landscape, intuitive parameter tuning, and consistent frame-by-frame performance on video. Furthermore, we use 80,000 natural images and 80,000 paintings to train an inverse network that approximates the result of the optimization. This results in a procedure for artistic style transfer that is efficient but also allows arbitrary content and style images.},

abstract = {As more and more software projects engage agile methods, there are emerging patterns of success and failure. With growing adoption of agile methods, project managers increasingly need to understand the applicability to their projects and factors that drive key project performance characteristics. While some organizations affirm that agile methods solve all their problems, few have shown consistent success over a range of typical software projects. Agile methods have advantages, especially in accommodating change due to volatile requirements. However, they also present concomitant risks with managing the many dependent pieces of work distributed across a large project. Use of agile methods therefore presents a set of tradeoffs. This paper examines the impact of agile methods on the people involved in a project, the process under which a project is developed, and on the project itself in an attempt to allow project managers to evaluate the applicability using an agile method.},

Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to show that the amygdala and hypothalamus are more strongly activated in men than in women when viewing identical sexual stimuli. This was true even when women reported greater arousal. Sex differences were specific to the sexual nature of the stimuli, were restricted primarily to limbic regions, and were larger in the left amygdala than the right amygdala. Men and women showed similar activation patterns across multiple brain regions, including ventral striatal regions involved in reward. Our findings indicate that the amygdala mediates sex differences in responsiveness to appetitive and biologically salient stimuli; the human amygdala may also mediate the reportedly greater role of visual stimuli in male sexual behavior, paralleling prior animal findings.},

This article presents a framework that depicts constructs and indicators at various depths and provides guidelines for choosing from among these depths. The framework is then integrated with methods of construct validation based on the confirmatory factor analysis of multitrait-multimethod (MTMM) matrices. The authors apply these methods to the measurement of work values, using the Work Aspect Preference Scale (WAPS). Results show that the WAPS performs better when used to represent relatively specific work values as opposed to more global, general values. Further analyses supported the generalizability of the WAPS factor structure for men and women, although gender differences were found on structured means for several latent value dimensions.},

Sekund{\{}{\{}{\"{a}}{\}}{\}}rlit:
Bagozzi and Edwards (1998) provided a conceptual framework for representing
constructs in which they presented methods of construct specification using confirmatory
factor analytic methods. Arguing that issues related to construct depth and dimensionality
should determine the specificity of the relationships, four alternative measurement
models were described. The total disaggregation model is characterized by
the treatment of all relevant items as indicators of the latent construct of interest. The
partial disaggregation model and the partial aggregation model involve the combination
(e.g., through summing or averaging) of items into subsets, which, in turn, are
treated as indicators of the latent construct. Finally, the combination of all items in a
particular scale into a single indicator of the latent construct is termed the total aggregation
model.
Although previous authors have not used the terminology suggested by Bagozzi
and Edwards (1998), they have adopted strategies for creating composites (also
referred to as testlets or item parcels) that can be described by this nomenclature (e.g.,
Mathieu{\{}{\&}{\}}amp;Farr, 1991; Mathieu, Tannenbaum,{\{}{\&}{\}}amp;Salas, 1992).},

Detecting the viewers' emotions instantaneously can be used to find the emotional traces of videos. In this paper, we present our approach in instantaneously detecting the emotions of video viewers' emotions from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals and facial expressions. A set of emotion inducing videos were shown to participants while their facial expressions and physiological responses were recorded. The expressed valence (negative to positive emotions) in the videos of participants' faces were annotated by five annotators. The stimuli videos were also continuously annotated on valence and arousal dimensions. Long-short-term-memory recurrent neural networks (LSTM-RNN) and Continuous Conditional Random Fields (CCRF) were utilized in detecting emotions automatically and continuously. We found the results from facial expressions to be superior to the results from EEG signals. We analyzed the effect of the contamination of facial muscle activities on EEG signals and found that most of the emotionally valuable content in EEG features are as a result of this contamination. However, our statistical analysis showed that EEG signals still carry complementary information in presence of facial expressions.},

This paper examines the nature of design thinking as it differs from other ways of thinking. A model for compar- ing fields is introduced and a number of characteristics of creative individuals in general and designers in particular are presented. Preparing designers for participation in policy planning will be a challenge for design education.

In Studies 3 and 5, subjects completed daily mood reports for 70 and 30 days, respectively. In Study 4, subjects completed three-week, daily, and moment mood reports and also filled out reports when they experienced strong emotions. The principal finding was that the relation between positive and negative affect differed greatly depending on the time frame. The strongest negative correlation between the two affects occurred during emotional times. The correlation decreased in a linear fashion as the time span covered increased logarithmically. It appears that positive and negative affect are independent in terms of how much people feel in their lives over longer time periods. Researchers need to focus on the processes that underlie both positive and negative affect and that are responsible for producing their relative independence.},

Two different catalogues depicting the same assistive products were presented to two different groups of respondents. One of the catalogues simulated an ordinary kitchen catalogue and the other simulated a common assistive products catalogue. Although the main attribute mentioned for preferring one object over another was common to both groups, motivations behind its use differed between groups, and the context of presentation influenced the groups' opinions about the objects which were presented. The experiment suggests that by designing and presenting assistive products as general consumer goods it may be possible to reduce stigmatic elements from being associated with them.},

In contrast, this article studies relationships via a corpus of 30 British speed-dating encounters between 30-45-year-old heterosexual couples, in which talk about previous relationships was pervasively relevant. The analysis examines how talk about prior relationships, and current relationship status, was occasioned and accounted for. The first section shows that, in the overall structure of the date, talk about relationship histories was located after talk about other matters (e.g., occupation, place of residence). Second, relationship history questions contained design features for managing the delicacy of answering them (e.g., trail-off "or" turn endings), as well as paired categorial items (e.g., a question about children was answered in terms of one's marital status and vice versa). In the final section, the analysis shows that and how participants treat some relationship histories as more accountable than others (e.g., being never married). The analysis revealed a more general set of accountabilities: of being single, of being previously unsuccessful in relationships, of being unable to meet people in natural settings, and, therefore, for attending speed-dating events. Overall, the article demonstrates the importance of examining the richly detailed brief encounters of social life, in order to better understand people's understandings of, troubles with, and goals for their personal relationships. {\textcopyright} Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {Open communication and organizational trust are important factors in the context of organizational technology change. Although previous research has addressed the relationship between technology change and open communication, and issues concerning organizational trust and open communication, few investigations adequately address the interplay between all factors simultaneously. The relationship between perceptions of organizational trust and communication, as well as other organizational variables, were examined within the context of significant technology change in a division of a large federal agency. Perceptions of open communication during technology change were predicted from the organizational variables. The results show that organizational trust, supervisory leadership style, workgroup cohesion, and acceptance of change were significant predictors for open communication. Results support the contention that, if issues and concerns related to open communication and organizational trust are neglected, particularly in times of change, they may undermine efforts that would otherwise facilitate a smooth transition. Identifying the importance of these relationships for the division allows management to concentrate on areas most likely to enhance the transition process as the organization undergoes technology change.},

abstract = {Sentiment analysis is the task of automatically determining from text the attitude, emotion, or some other affectual state of the author. This chapter summarizes the diverse landscape of tasks and applications associated with sentiment analysis. We outline key challenges stemming from the complexity and subtlety of language use, the prevalence of creative and non-standard language, and the lack of paralinguistic information, such as tone and stress markers. We describe automatic systems and datasets commonly used in sentiment analysis. We summarize several manual and automatic approaches to creating valence- and emotion-association lexicons. We also discuss preliminary approaches for sentiment composition (how smaller units of text combine to express sentiment) and approaches for detecting sentiment in figurative and metaphoric language-these are the areas where we expect to see significant work in the near future.},

abstract = {In this paper, a design approach is introduced for designing products with added emotional value. First, the approach was established, based on a theoretical framework and a non-verbal instrument to measure emotional responses. Second, the value of the design approach was assessed by applying it to the design of mobile telephones. Mobile telephones were found to be useful vehicles as people appear to have strong feelings about this product. A user study was conducted which resulted in the identification of two user groups ('trend followers' and 'security seekers') and for each group an emotional profile. Four telephones were designed which, for each group, either were intended to or were not intended to match the group's profile. Finally, these designs were evaluated with the non-verbal instrument. The results indicate that the approach is appropriate for designing products with added emotional value. The advantages and disadvantages of the approach are discussed and further research directions indicated.},

abstract = {It is the central hypothesis of this paper that the mental states commonly referred to as altered states of consciousness are principally due to transient prefrontal cortex deregulation. Supportive evidence from psychological and neuroscientific studies of dreaming, endurance running, meditation, daydreaming, hypnosis, and various drug-induced states is presented and integrated. It is proposed that transient hypofrontality is the unifying feature of all altered states and that the phenomenological uniqueness of each state is the result of the differential viability of various frontal circuits. Using an evolutionary approach, consciousness is conceptualized as hierarchically ordered cognitive function. Higher-order structures perform increasingly integrative functions and thus contribute more sophisticated content. Although this implies a holistic approach to consciousness, such a functional hierarchy localizes the most sophisticated layers of consciousness in the zenithal higher-order structure: the prefrontal cortex. The hallmark of altered states of consciousness is the subtle modification of behavioral and cognitive functions that are typically ascribed to the prefrontal cortex. The theoretical framework presented yields a number of testable hypotheses. {\textcopyright}2002 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.},

Teachers' ratings of positive and negative social behavior, as well as peer-rated sociometric likability, were assessed for 43 preschoolers over a 10-mo period (average initial age = 45 months). Early in peer reputation formation, likability was associated with peer behavior: Friendlier, more cooperative, less aggressive, and less difficult children were more well liked. Later likability was predicted by earlier likability, not prosocial behavior; peer reputation appeared to be emerging as more important than social behavior in peers' judgments of likability. Although later prosocial behavior was found not to be a consequence of earlier likability, it was predicted by concurrent likability. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2008 APA, all rights reserved)},

abstract = {Background Research literature on problematic smartphone use, or smartphone addiction, has proliferated. However, relationships with existing categories of psychopathology are not well defined. We discuss the concept of problematic smartphone use, including possible causal pathways to such use. Method We conducted a systematic review of the relationship between problematic use with psychopathology. Using scholarly bibliographic databases, we screened 117 total citations, resulting in 23 peer-reviewer papers examining statistical relations between standardized measures of problematic smartphone use/use severity and the severity of psychopathology. Results Most papers examined problematic use in relation to depression, anxiety, chronic stress and/or low self-esteem. Across this literature, without statistically adjusting for other relevant variables, depression severity was consistently related to problematic smartphone use, demonstrating at least medium effect sizes. Anxiety was also consistently related to problem use, but with small effect sizes. Stress was somewhat consistently related, with small to medium effects. Self-esteem was inconsistently related, with small to medium effects when found. Statistically adjusting for other relevant variables yielded similar but somewhat smaller effects. Limitations We only included correlational studies in our systematic review, but address the few relevant experimental studies also. Conclusions We discuss causal explanations for relationships between problem smartphone use and psychopathology.},

abstract = {When an individual participates in empirical studies involving the visual arts, they most often are presented with a stream of images, shown on a computer, depicting reproductions of artworks by respected artists but which are often not known to the viewer. While art can of course be shown in presentia actuale-e.g., in the museum-this laboratory paradigm has become our go-to basis for assessing interaction, and, often in conjunction with some means of rating, for assessing evaluative, emotional, cognitive, and even neurophysiological response. However, the question is rarely asked: Do participants actually believe that every image that they are viewing is indeed "Art"? Relatedly, how does this evaluation relate to aesthetic appreciation, and do the answers to these questions vary in accordance with different strategies and interpersonal differences? In this paper, we consider the spontaneous classification of digital reproductions as art or not art. Participants viewed a range of image types-Abstract, Hyperrealistic, Poorly Executed paintings, Readymade sculptures, as well as Renaissance and Baroque paintings. They classified these as "art" or "not art" using both binary and analog scales, and also assessed for liking. Almost universally, individuals did not find all items within a class to be "art," nor did all participants agree on the arthood status for any one item. Art classification in turn showed a significant positive correlation with liking. Whether an object was classified as art moreover correlated with specific personality variables, tastes, and decision strategies. The impact of these findings is discussed for selection/assessment of participants and for better understanding the basis of findings in past and future empirical art research.},

abstract = {Cues that reliably predict rewards trigger the thoughts and emotions normally evoked by those rewards. Humans and other animals will work, often quite hard, for these cues. This is termed conditioned reinforcement. The ability to use conditioned reinforcers to guide our behaviour is normally beneficial; however, it can go awry. For example, corporate icons, such as McDonald's Golden Arches, influence consumer behaviour in powerful and sometimes surprising ways, and drug-associated cues trigger relapse to drug seeking in addicts and animals exposed to addictive drugs, even after abstinence or extinction. Yet, despite their prevalence, it is not known how conditioned reinforcers control human or other animal behaviour. One possibility is that they act through the use of the specific rewards they predict; alternatively, they could control behaviour directly by activating emotions that are independent of any specific reward. In other words, the Golden Arches may drive business because they evoke thoughts of hamburgers and fries, or instead, may be effective because they also evoke feelings of hunger or happiness. Moreover, different brain circuits could support conditioned reinforcement mediated by thoughts of specific outcomes versus more general affective information. Here we have attempted to address these questions in rats. Rats were trained to learn that different cues predicted different rewards using specialized conditioning procedures that controlled whether the cues evoked thoughts of specific outcomes or general affective representations common to different outcomes. Subsequently, these rats were given the opportunity to press levers to obtain short and otherwise unrewarded presentations of these cues. We found that rats were willing to work for cues that evoked either outcome-specific or general affective representations. Furthermore the orbitofrontal cortex, a prefrontal region important for adaptive decision-making, was critical for the former but not for the latter form of conditioned reinforcement.},

We use 121 data sets, which represent the whole UCI data base (excluding the large-scale problems) and other own real problems, in order to achieve significant conclusions about the classifier behavior, not dependent on the data set col-lection. The classifiers most likely to be the bests are the random forest (RF) versions, the best of which (implemented in R and accessed via caret) achieves 94.1{\%} of the maximum accuracy overcoming 90{\%} in the 84.3{\%} of the data sets. However, the dif-ference is not statistically significant with the second best, the SVM with Gaussian kernel implemented in C using LibSVM, which achieves 92.3{\%} of the maximum accuracy. A few models are clearly better than the remaining ones: random forest, SVM with Gaussian and polynomial kernels, extreme learning machine with Gaussian kernel, C5.0 and avNNet (a committee of multi-layer perceptrons implemented in R with the caret package). The random forest is clearly the best family of classifiers (3 out of 5 bests classifiers are RF), followed by SVM (4 classifiers in the top-10), neural networks and boosting ensembles (5 and 3 members in the top-20, respectively).},

abstract = {Behavioral studies indicate that there exists a 'negativity bias' in the way surrounding events are processed. Particularly, it has been indicated that negative events elicit more rapid and more prominent responses than non-negative events. The objective of the present study was to explore the role of attention in relation to this negativity bias. Three groups of emotional pictures were used as stimuli: positive, negative and neutral. Event-related potentials were recorded from 35 subjects at F5, Fz, F6, C5, Cz, C6, P5, Pz and P6. Valence and arousal content of the stimulation was measured via a questionnaire. The experimental design ensured that subjects whose data were finally analyzed attended to the stimuli. ANOVAs showed that P200, an attention-related component, showed higher amplitudes and shorter latencies in response to negative stimuli than in response to positive stimuli. Additional partial correlation analyses indicated that P200 amplitude, but not latency, significantly associates (at frontal and central sites) with valence content of the stimulation. Therefore, due to the valence-related nature of the bias, it is concluded that intensity aspects (more than timing aspects) of the P200-related attentional processes are particularly involved in the negativity bias.

The hedonic quality of past events, however, had a congruent impact on well-being judgments only when thinking about them elicited affect in the present but otherwise had a contrast effect on these judgments. Two factors were found to determine if thinking about the past elicits affect: whether subjects describe the events vividly and in detail or only mention them briefly, and whether subjects describe how the events occurred rather than why they occurred. Possible mediating mechanisms and implications of these results are discussed.},

We examined how the mechanisms of fear conditioning apply when humans learn to associate social ingroup and outgroup members with a fearful event, with the goal of advancing our understanding of basic learning theory and social group interaction. Primates more readily associate stimuli from certain fear-relevant natural categories, such as snakes, with a negative outcome relative to stimuli from fear-irrelevant categories, such as birds. We assessed whether this bias in fear conditioning extends to social groups defined by race. Our results indicate that individuals from a racial group other than one's own are more readily associated with an aversive stimulus than individuals of one's own race, among both white and black Americans. This prepared fear response might be reduced by close, positive interracial contact.},

abstract = {In modern society, most companies exert great effort to raise their productivity and increase corporate levels of innovation. Many global companies in Korea emphasize creativity management for innovation and adopt various initiatives to stimulate creativity in employees. In this study, a structural equation model (SEM) was proposed to analyze the effects of basic skills, compensation systems, and external environment factors on creativity, and the effects of creativity factors on the innovative performance of an organization. In addition, based on the proposed SEM, the Organizational Creativity Index (OCI) was developed. One unique and important aspect of this research is the use of SEM. That is a powerful statistical technique that has not yet been fully utilized in studies of organizational creativity. Another contribution of this research is the development of the OCI. The results are expected to provide instructive information about how to improve creativity and innovative performance in various organ...},

abstract = {In this paper, we introduce the task of targeted aspect-based sentiment analysis. The goal is to extract fine-grained information with respect to entities mentioned in user comments. This work extends both aspect-based sentiment analysis that assumes a single entity per document and targeted sentiment analysis that assumes a single sentiment towards a target entity. In particular, we identify the sentiment towards each aspect of one or more entities. As a testbed for this task, we introduce the SentiHood dataset, extracted from a question answering (QA) platform where urban neighbourhoods are discussed by users. In this context units of text often mention several aspects of one or more neighbourhoods. This is the first time that a generic social media platform in this case a QA platform, is used for fine-grained opinion mining. Text coming from QA platforms is far less constrained compared to text from review specific platforms which current datasets are based on. We develop several strong baselines, relying on logistic regression and state-of-the-art recurrent neural networks.},

Research supports the growing importance of business networks, as firms are increasingly specialising on more limited sets of value adding activities. Co-creation has been described as particularly prevalent in business-to-business services marketing, where not one but several firms must work together to provide customers with satisfying co-creation experiences. This paper proposes a simple model in which business networks can be utilised to increase the value of co-creation experiences to assist in increasing competitive advantage and customer retention.},

Team members completed a task in which they were required to identify on a matrix the best sites for oil drilling based on distributed information. Member interactions during a plan­ ning period were recorded by using Bales' encoding system. Team performance was the number of correct sites selected by members. Analyses indicated that high task-cohesive teams (a) devoted more time to planning and information exchange during the planning period and (b) communicated task-relevant infor­ mation more frequently during the performance period than low task-cohesive teams. Also, planned comparisons indicated that low task-cohesive, high tem­ porally urgent teams performed significantly worse than teams in the other three conditions. High task-cohesive, high temporally urgent teams performed as well as teams in both of the low time-pressure conditions. These data indicate that task cohesion can improve team decision making under temporal stress.},

The struggle is fueled by the dynamic tension that exists between delivering Midas feature-rich versions of products and services using extravagant engineering and delivering low-cost Hermes versions of products and services using frugal engineering (see Figure 1). Midas versions are high-end products for nonprice-sensitive consumers. Hermes versions are for price-sensitive consumers. The results of this dynamic tension between Midas versioning and Hermes versioning are Atlas products and services. Atlas products and services are designed for mainstream consumers. Atlas products and services incorporate the product design features that will attract the broadest customer base and will also be profitable. The driving force behind the development of Midas, Atlas, and Hermes versions is driven by the implicit creative genius that everyone possess and most businesses should possess as they engage in continuous learning-about and learn-by-doing activities.},

This paper contributes to discussions about design thinking by using theoretical practice perspectives to attend to what constitutes design practices. Two aspects of practice theories are discussed: the role of objects in constituting practices, and how knowledge is understood. Three studies of organizations in which a practice lens has been applied are discussed, which introduce ideas of strategy-as-practice, technologies-in-practice and the role of visual practices in constituting knowledge. Drawing together these two traditions practice theories within organization studies, and design studies a pair of concepts is proposed: design- as-practice and designs-in-practice which combine insights from previous organizational research analysed using practice theory. Finally, implications for research in management and design are discussed.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Global smartphone penetration has led to unprecedented addictive behaviors. The aims of this study are to develop diagnostic criteria of smartphone addiction and to examine the discriminative ability and the validity of the diagnostic criteria. METHODS We developed twelve candidate criteria for characteristic symptoms of smartphone addiction and four criteria for functional impairment caused by excessive smartphone use. The participants consisted of 281 college students. Each participant was systematically assessed for smartphone-using behaviors by psychiatrist's structured diagnostic interview. The sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy of the candidate symptom criteria were analyzed with reference to the psychiatrists' clinical global impression. The optimal model selection with its cutoff point of the diagnostic criteria differentiating the smartphone addicted subjects from non-addicted subjects was then determined by the best diagnostic accuracy. RESULTS Six symptom criteria model with optimal cutoff point were determined based on the maximal diagnostic accuracy. The proposed smartphone addiction diagnostic criteria consisted of (1) six symptom criteria, (2) four functional impairment criteria and (3) exclusion criteria. Setting three symptom criteria as the cutoff point resulted in the highest diagnostic accuracy (84.3{\%}), while the sensitivity and specificity were 79.4{\%} and 87.5{\%}, respectively. We suggested determining the functional impairment by two or more of the four domains considering the high accessibility and penetration of smartphone use. CONCLUSION The diagnostic criteria of smartphone addiction demonstrated the core symptoms "impaired control" paralleled with substance related and addictive disorders. The functional impairment involved multiple domains provide a strict standard for clinical assessment.},

In this framework, domain knowledge becomes explicit as a significant component to be taught and transferred in design education. The Think-Maps framework proposes that by constructing a conceptual map that reflects one's thinking in a domain, we make explicit the knowledge learned. The learner constructs structured representations of concepts and their relationships to other concepts and fills these structures with the content of the specific design domain or design task. This resulting structured representation of knowledge can later be accessed and expanded in additional processes of design thinking. Web-Pad - a computational tool that implements these ideas is presented and illustrated. Web-Pad is used for organizing and representing conceptual maps of a specific domain. The Think-Maps framework and the Web-Pad tool are demonstrated in an educational environment. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Herbert Simon has warned us that an explanatory account of human rationality must identify the significance of emotions for choice behavior. Customarily emphasizing the cognitive dimensions of decision making, relatively few researchers have paid close attention to specifying the complex ways in which emotion may shape human thinking and decisions. Accordingly, this paper is an attempt to follow Simon's suggestion and specify how emotions can enter into the theory of bounded rationality. To accomplish our task, we capitalize on Rom Harr??'s work on causal powers, from which we propose a strategy to study the significance of emotion in decision-making processes. In an attempt to elaborate on an explanation of behavior by mechanism, we discuss a version of bounded rationality recently put forward by Gigerenzer, Todd, and the ABC Research Group [Simple Heuristics that Make us Smart, Oxford University Press, New York, 1999] and Gigerenzer and Selten [Bounded Rationality: The Adaptive Toolbox, MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, 2001, pp. 1-12], the so-called adaptive toolbox of fast and frugal heuristics. Coupled with insights from evolutionary psychology and neuroscience, this version of bounded rationality gives us a better grasp of the functional role of emotions within the human decision machinery. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {This study focuses on the concept of Critical Design, which describes the development and use of design objects for the discussion of social and technological problem areas. Critical Design provokes or puzzles the consumer. Instead of offering people merely optimized and constraint action patterns, open situations and questions are created. The arising reactions provide valuable insights for innovative product development and basic design research. This paper assesses the potential of Critical Design approaches to be utilized as novel research tools for future challenges to design. The main contributions of this paper are threefold. Firstly, it reviews various ways of user engagement to design that reinterprets the conventional relationship of user and designer. Secondly, it selects and evaluates specific qualitative research methodologies that accept and support the active involvement of the researcher as well as the importance of letting theories "emerge" out of data, in order to develop a methodological research framework specific and original to design. Finally, the study offers an assessment of Critical Designs potential, to understand and deal with people in a novel and richer way and to test it as a research tool that supports complex approaches. Critical Design illustrates the need for design researcher to deal with complexity encountered in the general dynamic of actors and in people's critical thinking.},

Conformity refers to thinking and acting in expected, accepted, and conventional ways. Few things could seem further from creativity. Indeed, creativity is often associated with “thinking outside the box” and new ways of thought and action. In fact, if you were to perform a quick Internet search on the terms creativity and conformity, you likely would find commentaries that describe the perils of conformity and how it can stifle or even kill creativity. Although the idea that conformity can stifle creativity seems clear, the actual relationship between creativity and con- formity is not as straightforward as it may initially seem.

This paper reviews research results published in scientific journals in the period 2000{\{}{\_}{\}}/2005, and assesses current knowledge of teams and associated psychological factors. Furthermore, the review process identified the importance of team constituent factors (interdependence and team autonomy), team type and team size, and contextual factors for the results that were reported, and assessed the design and research-methodological foundations of those results. The main inclusion criteria for papers were that they had been based on field studies of formally established teams and were published in peer-reviewed scientific journals. Furthermore they must have been based on the use of questionnaires, and the occupational sector must have been identified. Fifty-five papers were identified for inclusion in the review. An almost consistent pattern of positive associations between psychological variables and teamwork was found to be reported across team types, team sizes, and contextual factors. Furthermore, the reported psychological factors appear to be positively linked to team autonomy and team interdependence. This paper discusses the strength of the interactions between teamwork and various psychological variables, and suggests directions for future research.},

Analyses of data collected from 172 members of 23 matrix teams indicated that member perceptions of team-level politics were negatively related to executive and member ratings of effectiveness and to member expressions of satisfaction with and commitment to the matrix team. In addition, results of moderated multiple regression analyses indicated that member-team goal congruence moderated these relationships. Perceptions of politics were more strongly related to the outcome variables among individuals who did not share the priorities of their team members than among those whose goal priorities were consistent. These results suggest that leaders can help their team members cope with politics by making efforts to ensure that they share goal priorities of team members.

A Little Creativity Goes a Long Way: An Examination of Teams? Engagement in Creative Processes. Journal of Management, Vol. 30, No. 4, 453-470

Using surveys and interview data this research examines teams? engagement in creative processes. Results of cluster analysis indicated that the more creative teams were those that perceived that their tasks required high levels of creativity, were working on jobs with high task interdependence, were high on shared goals, valued participative problem-solving, and had a climate supportive of creativity. In addition, members of the more creative teams spent more time socializing with each other and had moderate amounts of organizational tenure. Implications for management are discussed.

Perceived uncertainty in self-managed service teams: an empirical assessment
This empirical study examines the impact of context-team factors and team-employee factors on perceived uncertainty in self-managed service teams. The results of our study show that context-team factors rather than team-employee factors are critical to the extent of uncertainty employees perceive when providing customer service. Furthermore, perceived uncertainty has negative impact on self-managed team outcomes in terms of job satisfaction and intention to leave the team. Besides this, our findings indicate that team commitment to customer service quality can serve as an effective tool to handle the negative consequences of perceived uncertainty in self-managed service teams. Finally, in addition to the cross-sectional analysis, a longitudinal exploration has been carried out, the outcomes of which suggest that the structural relationships are changing over time, underlining the need to take dynamic considerations into account in analyzing the effectiveness of self-managed work teams.

This research investigated the relationship among a team's EI, the team leader's EI, and team performance. Using the three components of Salovey and Mayer's (1990) conception of emotional intelligence: understanding emotion, managing emotion, and identifying emotions, the study assessed the EI and performance levels of customer service teams and their leaders. Of the three components of EI studied, only understanding emotion and managing emotion positively correlated with some measures of team performance.

The impact of organizational context on work team effectiveness: a study of production team
Teams are an integral part of many manufacturing organizations today. This paper explores the relationships between nine organizational context variables, team processes, and three measures of team effectiveness. The research was conducted within one business unit of a Fortune 50 high-technology company. Twenty-one intact production work teams were the focus of the study. Using path analysis, significant direct relationships between six organizational context factors and three measures of team effectiveness were found. The management processes associated with establishing a clear team purpose that is aligned with organizational goals and the allocation of critical resources were both positively related to team member satisfaction. An organizational culture that supports communication and cooperation between teams and the integration of teams was found to have a significant and positive linear relationship with two different team leader ratings of effectiveness and with team member satisfaction. Organizational systems that provide teams with the necessary information were found to have a significant and positive linear relationship with both team leader ratings of effectiveness and team member satisfaction. Organizational systems that provide teams with the necessary training were found to have a significant and positive linear relationship with team member satisfaction.

In the course of doing this, we identify a set of design strategies that helped to sustain the collaboration. Based on our experiences, we recognise the need for developing design strategies for extended and evolutionary design collaborations with ordinary communities that have special needs, and do not possess significant resourcing, design experience or skills in the technology in question. Such communities of practice pose challenges to shorter term project-centred forms of co-design and also require updates to the existing extended design approaches, which rest on relatively high user skill and resourcing.

abstract = {Five experiments examined preferences for horizontal positions in multiobject pictures. In Experiment 1, each picture contained a fixed object and an object whose position could be adjusted to create the most (or least) aesthetically pleasing image. Observers placed the movable object closer to the fixed object when the objects were related than when they were unrelated (a relatedness bias) but almost never overlapped them (a separation bias). Experiment 2 showed that these results were not due to demand characteristics by replicating them almost exactly in a between-participants design. In Experiment 3, preference rankings revealed a strong relatedness bias together with an inward bias toward the spatial envelope of objects to point into the frame. A weak balance effect was evident in a multiple regression analysis. Experiment 4 replicated the inward bias for the spatial envelope using multiobject groups. Experiment 5 generalized the above findings for different objects when observers had to choose between image pairs that differed only in interobject distance or degree of balance. Strong relatedness effects were again present, but there was no evidence of any preference for balance. {\textcopyright} 2012 M H R Leyssen, S Linsen, J Sammartino, S E Palmer.},

In this paper, we show how the combined strength and wisdom of the crowds can be used to generate a large, high-quality, word-emotion and word-polarity association lexicon quickly and inexpensively. We enumerate the challenges in emotion annotation in a crowdsourcing scenario and propose solutions to address them. Most notably, in addition to questions about emotions associated with terms, we show how the inclusion of a word choice question can discourage malicious data entry, help to identify instances where the annotator may not be familiar with the target term (allowing us to reject such annotations), and help to obtain annotations at sense level (rather than at word level). We conducted experiments on how to formulate the emotion-annotation questions, and show that asking if a term is associated with an emotion leads to markedly higher interannotator agreement than that obtained by asking if a term evokes an emotion. {\textcopyright}2012 National Research Council Canada.},

abstract = {We propose a novel approach for learning features from weakly-supervised data by joint ranking and classification. In order to exploit data with weak labels, we jointly train a feature extraction network with a ranking loss and a classification network with a cross-entropy loss. We obtain high-quality compact discriminative features with few parameters, learned on relatively small datasets without additional annotations. This enables us to tackle tasks with specialized images not very similar to the more generic ones in existing fully-supervised datasets. We show that the resulting features in combination with a linear classifier surpass the state-of-the-art on the Hipster Wars dataset despite using features only 0.3{\%} of the size. Our proposed features significantly outperform those obtained from networks trained on ImageNet, despite being 32 times smaller (128 single-precision floats), trained on noisy and weakly-labeled data, and using only 1.5{\%} of the number of parameters.},

abstract = {The impact of a group goal on the performance of anonymous and nonin- teracting group members performing an additive group task was tested. Pro- cesses believed to mediate the effect, the role of self-set individual goals, the impact of information about the group's previous performance on the task (group knowledge of results; GRPKR) on goal commitment, and the motiva- tional basis of the goal were also assessed. Seventeen groups of three to five people performed two trials of an idea generation task. In the GOAL/GRPKR condition, group members were assigned a group goal for Session 2 and received information about the group's performance for Session 1. In the goal without knowledge of results (GOAL/NOKR) condition, group mem- bers were assigned a group goal for Session 2 without GRPKR. In the NO- GOAL condition, group members worked without a goal and without GRPKR. In each condition, group members worked on the task without talk- ing to other group members and individual contributions to the group prod- uct were unknown to others. Self-reports of effort, changes in individual performance strategies from Rial 1 to Rial 2, self-set individual goals, goal commitment, and personal challenge were collected. Results showed that (a) group members working toward a performance goal outperformed those working without a goal, b) information about the group's previous perfor- mance on the task did not influence commitment to the goal or performance, (c) changes in individual performance strategies mediated the group goal ef- fect but self-reports of effort invested in the task did not, (d) g m {\{}{\~{}}{\}} p members working toward a group goal felt more personal challenge than group mem- bers working without a goal, and (e) self-set individual goals can not account for the group goal effect. The implications of these results for models of group goals and group performance are discussed.},

Goal commitment is
an attachment to or determination to reach a goal that is crucial
to the success of the goal intervention (Locke, Shaw, Saari, {\{}{\&}{\}}amp;
Latham, 1981). Goal commitment is important because it determines
the extent to which an individual mobilizes personal
resources to meet the goal (Locke {\{}{\&}{\}}amp; Latham, 1990, chap. 6).
Using a framework similar to that used by Locke, Latham,
and Erez (1988) and Hollenbeck and Klein (1987) to analyze
factors that influence commitment to an individual goal, Weldon
and Weingart (1988) suggested variables that influence
commitment to a group goal. Two of these, perceived legitimacy
of an assigned goal and challenge-seeking motives, were
expected to produce commitment in this experiment},

While there are many applications for face recognition technology in which one can control the parameters of image acquisition, there are also many applications in which the practitioner has little or no control over such parameters. This database, Labeled Faces in the Wild, is provided as an aid in studying the latter, unconstrained, recognition problem. The database contains labeled face photographs spanning the range of conditions typically encountered in everyday life. The database exhibits “natural” variability in factors such as pose, lighting, race, accessories, occlusions, and background. In addition to describing the details of the database, we provide specific experimental paradigms for which the database is suitable. This is done in an effort to make research performed with the database as consistent and comparable as possible. We provide baseline results, including results of a state of the art face recognition system combined with a face alignment system. To facilitate experimentation on the database, we provide several parallel databases, including an aligned version.},

If you use analytical thinking alone, you will just extrapolate from the past, which will work for you if you are willing to accept a future that is no different from the past. If you use intuitive thinking alone, you won't take advantage in a rigorous way of the data that's available. Both of them are needed.

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Inspiration is a widely recognized phenomenon in everyday life. However, researchers still know very little about what the process of inspiration entails. This paper investigates designers' approaches when selecting inspirational stimuli during the initial phases of a design process. We conducted a think-aloud protocol study and interviews with 31 design Masters students while generating ideas for a design problem. The results indicate that searching for and selecting stimuli require different levels of cognitive effort, depending on whether there is unlimited or limited access to stimuli. Furthermore, three important stages of the inspiration process were identified: keyword definition, stimuli search and stimuli selection. For each of these stages, we elaborate on how designers define keywords, which search approaches they use and what drives their selection of stimuli. This paper contributes to an understanding of how designers can be supported in their inspiration process in a more detailed manner.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We show that embodiment underlies social information processing when the perceiver interacts with actual social objects (online cognition) and when the perceiver represents social objects in their absence (offline cognition). Although many empirical demonstrations of social embodiment exist, no particularly compelling account of them has been offered. We propose that theories of embodied cognition, such as the Perceptual Symbol Systems (PSS) account (Barsalou, 1999), explain and integrate these findings, and that they also suggest exciting new directions for research. We compare the PSS account to a variety of related proposals and show how it addresses criticisms that have previously posed problems for the general embodiment approach.},

If such a system is hierarchical, an end-node server handles the requests from a particular area, the next server in the hierarchy takes the request over for several end-node servers if those can not answer the request and so on. This architecture provides for cost efficiency, reliability and scalability of servers. The end-node serv- ers store only a limited set of the overall available information which changes over time due to user interests. If a video is requested which is not available, this server contacts the next server in the hierarchy. To decide the size and location of the video servers and the location of videos in the hierarchy, the access behaviour of users must be considered. Various models for the simulation of user behavior (and thus, of the load induced on the video servers) have been presented in the literature. Only a few of these models are designed to take long-term effects into account because the basis for most of the models are short-term influences on a single video server and the load on this single machine. In this paper we describe a new user behavior model and show that various assumptions made within other models are unrealistic.},

Sixty percent of global psychologists routinely used a formal classification system, with ICD-10 used most frequently by 51{\%} and DSM-IV by 44{\%}. Psychologists viewed informing treatment decisions and facilitating communication as the most important purposes of classification, and preferred flexible diagnostic guidelines to strict criteria. Clinicians favorably evaluated most diagnostic categories, but identified a number of problematic diagnoses. Substantial percentages reported problems with crosscultural applicability and cultural bias, especially among psychologists outside the USA and Europe. Findings underscore the priority of clinical utility and professional and cultural differences in international psychology. Implications for ICD-11 development and dissemination are discussed.},

Half the interviewers were given biassing true and false information about the event; half were given no information. As predicted, only poor interviewers showed the effect of bias. Poor interviewers asked fewer open questions in the biassed condition than the non-biassed condition; good interviewers asked the same (high) proportion of open questions in both conditions. Poor interviewers asked more leading questions in the biassed condition than the non-biassed condition; good interviewers asked the same (low) proportion of leading questions in both conditions.

abstract = {The capacity to appreciate beauty is one of our species' most remarkable traits. Although knowledge about its neural correlates is growing, little is known about any gender-related differences. We have explored possible differences between men and women's neural correlates of aesthetic preference. We have used magnetoencephalography to record the brain activity of 10 male and 10 female participants while they decided whether or not they considered examples of artistic and natural visual stimuli to be beautiful. Our results reveal significantly different activity between the sexes in parietal regions when participants judged the stimuli as beautiful. Activity in this region was bilateral in women, whereas it was lateralized to the right hemisphere in men. It is known that the dorsal visual processing stream, which encompasses the superior parietal areas, has been significantly modified throughout human evolution. We posit that the observed gender-related differences are the result of evolutionary processes that occurred after the splitting of the human and chimpanzee lineages. In view of previous results on gender differences with respect to the neural correlates of coordinate and categorical spatial strategies, we infer that the different strategies used by men and women in assessing aesthetic preference may reflect differences in the strategies associated with the division of labor between our male and female hunter-gatherer hominin ancestors.},

However, few studies have examined the relationship between group efficacy and other group variables that contribute to long-term group productivity. This study addresses the relationship between group efficacy and other group variables. Specifically, it examines the relationships between group efficacy and group viability, personal learning and development, satisfaction with leadership opportunities, and the ability to work independently within the group. Results suggest that group efficacy has a beneficial effect on group dynamics and overall group effectiveness. Groups with higher levels of group efficacy rated higher on group viability, learning and self-development while within the group, and opportunities for individual autonomy. Group efficacy was not found to have an impact on satisfaction with leadership opportunities. Implications of these findings and suggestions for future research are addressed.},

Findings from the study reported here (N = 1978) support this prediction. Maximizers reported significantly higher intentions to switch to another service provider (television provider) than satisficers. Maximizers' intentions to switch appear to be intensified and mediated by higher proneness to regret, increased desire to discuss relevant choices with others, higher levels of perceived knowledge of alternatives, and higher ego involvement in the end product, compared to satisficers.

abstract = {Twitter is a microblogging website where users read and write millions of short messages on a variety of topics every day. This study uses the context of the German federal election to investigate whether Twitter is used as a forum for political deliberation and whether online messages on Twitter validly mirror offline political sentiment. Using LIWC text analysis software, we conducted a content analysis of over 100,000 messages containing a reference to either a political party or a politician. Our results show that Twitter is indeed used extensively for political deliberation. We find that the mere number of messages mentioning a party reflects the election result. Moreover, joint mentions of two parties are in line with real world political ties and coalitions. An analysis of the tweets' political sentiment demonstrates close correspondence to the parties' and politicians' political positions indicating that the content of Twitter messages plausibly reflects the offline political landscape. We discuss the use of microblogging message content as a valid indicator of political sentiment and derive suggestions for further research.},

Longitudinal data were obtained as part of a national study, the Harvard Study of Health and Life Quality, and proposed models were evaluated with structural equation modeling. Results supported a partially mediated model, such that general mental ability and physical attractiveness exhibited both direct and indirect effects on income, as mediated by educational attainment and core self-evaluations. Finally, income negatively predicted financial strain, whereas core self-evaluations had both a direct and an indirect (through income) negative effect on financial strain. Overall, the results suggest that looks (physical attractiveness), brains (intelligence), and personality (core self-evaluations) are all important to income and financial strain.},

abstract = {This book presents a thorough overview of a model of human functioning based on the idea that behavior is goal-directed and regulated by feedback control processes. It describes feedback processes and their application to behavior, considers goals and the idea that goals are organized hierarchically, examines affect as deriving from a different kind of feedback process, and analyzes how success expectancies influence whether people keep trying to attain goals or disengage. Later sections consider a series of emerging themes, including dynamic systems as a model for shifting among goals, catastrophe theory as a model for persistence, and the question of whether behavior is controlled or instead 'emerges'. Three chapters consider the implications of these various ideas for understanding maladaptive behavior, and the closing chapter asks whether goals are a necessity of life. Throughout, theory is presented in the context of diverse issues that link the theory to other literatures.

p.60
An explicit rejection of control theory comes from Locke and Latham (1990a), whose work focuses on work motivation. There's a great deal in their own thinking that resembles the feedback model we're describing in this book. For example, they stat that {\{}{\&}{\}}quot;Goal setting is ... usually only effective when feedback allows performance to be tracked in relation to one's goals{\{}{\&}{\}}quot; (Locke {\{}{\&}{\}}amp; Latham, 1990b, p. 241). Despite this, and despite their nods of approval to other models with similar structures (e.g., Frese {\{}{\&}{\}}amp; Sabini, 1985), they recoil at the idea that the functions embedded in their theory (and others) reflect the operation of feedback processes.
The crux of their objection seems to be that feedback models are inappropriate because they are mechanistic. Locke and Latham's theory places a good deal of stress on the {\{}{\&}{\}}quot;causal efficacy of consciuosness{\{}{\&}{\}}quot;, a labored way of saying {\{}{\&}{\}}quot;will{\{}{\&}{\}}quot;. Feedback models are inadequate, in their view, because they don't portray behavior as a series of willful choices.

abstract = {In highly dynamic environments, characterized by changing customer preferences and uncertainty
about competitive products, managing the development of a new product is a complex
managerial task. 
The traditional practice, recommended in the literature, of reaching a sharp
definition early in the new product development (NPD) process may not be optimal, desirable
or even feasible in such dynamic situations. 
Under high uncertainty, forcing early finalization of specifications may result in a firm getting locked into an incorrect definition.

Based on our study of NPD in the high technology industry, we present a model of an approach called realtime
definition, in which a firm adapts its product definition process to the market and competitive
environment. 
Uncertainty in the product definition is resolved through frequent, repeated interactions
with customers and using a flexible development process. We find that early definition
is optimal only in a limited set of situations. To maximize its anticipated profits, a firm should
tune its definition process to the prevailing level of market uncertainty, the marginal value of
information obtained from the customer during the NPD process, and its own risk-profile and
internal development capabilities. Effects of competition on a firm's definition approach are also
examined, and implications for managers of a NPD process are presented using a conceptual
framework.},

For example, 3 decades of research demonstrate a robust cross-sectional relationship between extraversion and positive affect. A handful of studies, however, have examined this link experimentally, showing that extraversion boosts positive affect over short durations. If this is true, behaving in an extraverted manner should be a reliable method for increasing positive affect and, thus, suitable as a wellbeing- increasing practice. The current study instructed participants to engage in both extraverted and introverted behavior, each for 1 week. Participants increased in well-being when they were assigned to act extraverted and decreased in well-being when they were assigned to act introverted. These findings suggest that changing behavior associated with personality is possible and can impact well-being.

We further identify possible situational factors that influence reinforcement sensitivity from social, experiential, and technological perspectives.

To this aim, the present study applied psychological research methodology and yielded the first quantitative insight into this research question. Fifty-six graphic design students produced 13,195 ideas in six experimental sessions of brain-writing, averaging 36.1 ideas per person and experimental session after removal of outliers. The quantitative outcomes of these sessions were combined for pairwise comparisons to test the effect of session type (long session vs. sequenced session), warm-up session (sequenced session vs. long session), interval duration (decreasing intervals vs. shortened overall interval). Results revealed positive effects with large effect sizes in the range of 57–72 percent increase in creative performance for sequenced sessions over long and continuous sessions (H1), for long sessions following a sequenced session (H2a), and for extremely short interval duration over short interval duration of 3 minutes (H3b). Decreasing the interval duration in three subsequent sessions showed a moderate increase (+21{\%}) over short interval duration (H3a). These results are relevant for design educators and design thinking practitioners as they provide consistent evidence for optimized creative performance if ideation sessions are structured in several intervals of extremely short duration.},

Results show that increases in employee creative role identity and perceived creative expectation from supervisors over a 6-month time period were associated with enhanced sense of employee capacity for creative work. Contrary to what was expected, employees who experienced increased requirements for creativity in their jobs actually reported a decreased sense of efficaciousness for creative work. Results show that increases in creative self-efficacy corresponded with increases in creative performance as well.},

abstract = {Social networking has become commonplace in today's always-connected world. Due to this ubiquity, researchers have sought to explore the positive and negative effects that can result from usage of social networking. This research has shown many effects on an individual's psychological well-being, with one of the most concerning being mixed results of how usage relates to depression. In this study, we further examine the relationship between usage and depression for social networking users. In addition, we posit that aspects of cognitive absorption, namely temporal dissonance, focused immersion, and heightened enjoyment, have a direct effect on the amount of usage. A survey of 251 social networking users reveals that temporal dissociation and heightened enjoyment are associated with increased usage, and usage was found to be associated with greater levels of depression. Further, prior research has shown a significant difference between genders in Internet usage and social networking. Therefore, we report our findings as an overall analysis and as a gender-based betweengroups analysis. This analysis shows that more variance is explained for females than males in most relationships. Implications for research and society are discussed along with future research directions.

abstract = {Many animals find extreme versions of secondary sexual characteristics attractive, and such preferences can enhance reproductive success (Andersson, 1994). We hypothesized, therefore, that extreme versions of sex-typical traits may be attractive in human faces. We created supermale and superfemale faces by exaggerating all spatial differences between an average male and an average female face. In Expt 1 the male average was preferred to a supermale (50{\%} exaggeration of differences from the female average). There was no clear preference for the female average or the superfemale (50{\%} exaggeration). In Expt 2, participants chose the most attractive face from sets of images containing feminized as well as masculinized images for each sex, and spanning a wider range of exaggeration levels than in Expt 1. Chinese sets were also shown, to see whether similar preferences would occur for a less familiar race (participants were Caucasian). The most attractive female image was significantly feminized for faces of both races. However, the most attractive male image for both races was also significantly feminized. These results indicate that feminization, rather than sex exaggeration per se, is attractive in human faces, and they corroborate similar findings by Perrett et al. (1998).},

abstract = {The Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM) is a non-verbal pictorial assessment technique that directly measures the pleasure, arousal, and dominance associated with a person's affective reaction to a wide variety of stimuli. In this experiment, we compare reports of affective experience obtained using SAM, which requires only three simple judgments, to the Semantic Differential scale devised by Mehrabian and Russell (An approach to environmental psychology, 1974) which requires 18 different ratings. Subjective reports were measured to a series of pictures that varied in both affective valence and intensity. Correlations across the two rating methods were high both for reports of experienced pleasure and felt arousal. Differences obtained in the dominance dimension of the two instruments suggest that SAM may better track the personal response to an affective stimulus. SAM is an inexpensive, easy method for quickly assessing reports of affective response in many contexts. {\textcopyright}1994.},

Given that research on compulsive smartphone use is scarce in the information systems literature, this paper aims to reveal its significant determinants to enrich the theoretical development in this area. In particular, we incorporate flow, reinforcement motives (i.e., instant gratification and mood regulation), and convenience in the research model to examine their influences on compulsive smartphone use. We conduct an empirical online survey with 384 valid responses to assess the model. The findings show that flow and reinforcement motives have direct and significant effects on compulsive use. Convenience affects compulsive use indirectly through flow, while flow further mediates the effects of reinforcement motives on compulsive use. Implications for both research and practice are offered.},

Major findings are reviewed about preferences for colors (single colors, color combinations, and color harmony), spatial structure (low-level spatial properties, shape properties, and spatial composition within a frame), and individual differences in both color and spatial structure. Major theoretical accounts of aesthetic response are outlined and evaluated, including explanations in terms of mere exposure effects, arousal dynamics, categorical prototypes, ecological factors, perceptual and conceptual fluency, and the interaction of multiple components. The results of the review support the conclusion that aesthetic response can be studied rigorously and meaningfully within the framework of scientific psychology.},

abstract = {The use of the senses of vision and audition as interactive means has dominated the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) for decades, even though nature has provided us with many more senses for perceiving and interacting with the world around us. That said, it has become attractive for HCI researchers and designers to harness touch, taste, and smell in interactive tasks and experience design. In this paper, we present research and design insights gained throughout an interdisciplinary collaboration on a six-week multisensory display – Tate Sensorium – exhibited at the Tate Britain art gallery in London, UK. This is a unique and first time case study on how to design art experiences whilst considering all the senses (i.e., vision, sound, touch, smell, and taste), in particular touch, which we exploited by capitalizing on a novel haptic technology, namely, mid-air haptics. We first describe the overall set up of Tate Sensorium and then move on to describing in detail the design process of the mid-air haptic feedback and its integration with sound for the Full Stop painting by John Latham (1961). This was the first time that mid-air haptic technology was used in a museum context over a prolonged period of time and integrated with sound to enhance the experience of visual art. As part of an interdisciplinary team of curators, sensory designers, sound artists, we selected a total of three variations of the mid-air haptic experience (i.e., haptic patterns), which were alternated at dedicated times throughout the six-week exhibition. We collected questionnaire-based feedback from 2500 visitors and conducted 50 interviews to gain quantitative and qualitative insights on visitors' experiences and emotional reactions. Whilst the questionnaire results are generally very positive with only a small variation of the visitors' arousal ratings across the three tactile experiences designed for the Full Stop painting, the interview data shed light on the differences in the visitors' subjective experiences. Our findings suggest multisensory designers and art curators can ensure a balance between surprising experiences versus the possibility of free exploration for visitors. In addition, participants expressed that experiencing art with the combination of mid-air haptic and sound was immersive and provided an up-lifting experience of touching without touch. We are convinced that the insights gained from this large-scale and real-world field exploration of multisensory experience design exploiting a new and emerging technology provide a solid starting point for the HCI community, creative industries, and art curators to think beyond conventional art experiences. Specifically, our work demonstrates how novel mid-air technology can make art more emotionally engaging and stimulating, especially abstract art that is often open to interpretation.},

abstract = {Continues the authors' (see record 1979-13073-001) study of learned helplessness. Previous findings indicate that helpless children attributed their failure to lack of ability and viewed them as insurmountable. Mastery-oriented children, in contrast, tended to emphasize motivational factors and to view failure as surmountable. Although the performance of the 2 groups was usually identical during success or prior to failure, research suggested that these groups may well differ in the degree to which they perceived that their successes are replicable and their failures are avoidable. In the present study, 56 male and 56 female 4th–6th graders performed a task on which they encountered success and then failure. 56 Ss were asked a series of questions about their performance after success and 56 after failure. Compared to mastery-oriented Ss, helpless Ss underestimated the number of successes (and overestimated the number of failures), did not view successes as indicative of ability, and did not expect the successes to continue. Subsequent failure led them to devalue their performance but left the mastery-oriented Ss undaunted. Thus, for helpless children, successes are less salient, less predictive, and less enduring—less successful. (19 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved)},

First, based on a comprehensive literature survey and insights from industrial case studies, a set of 25 requirements for change management methods are developed. Second, these requirements are used as benchmarking criteria to assess the CPM in comparison to seven other promising methods. Third, the best-in-class solutions for each requirement are investigated to draw improvement suggestions for the CPM. Finally, an enhanced ECM method which implements these improvements is presented.},

abstract = {Cognitive load theory (CLT) can provide guidelines to assist in the presentation of information in a manner that encourages learner activities that optimise intellectual performance. It is based on a cognitive architecture that consists of a limited working memory, with partly independent processing units for visual and audio information, which interacts with an unlimited long-term memory. According to the theory, the limitations of working memory can be circumvented by coding multiple elements of information as one element in cognitive schemata, by automating rules, and by using more than one presentation modality. This special issue consists of six articles from four countries and three continents on the instructional implications of CLT. The articles cover presenting instructional techniques for increasing germane CL in studying worked examples (van Merri{\"{e}}nboer, Schuurman, De Croock, {\&} Paas), effects of example elaboration training on decreasing cognitive interference and overload (Stark, Mandl, Gruber, {\&} Renkl), CLT-based instructional design when dealing with very high element interactivity material (Pollock, Chandler, {\&} Sweller), effects of worked examples on CL in older learners (Van Gerven, Paas, {\&} Schmidt), a cognitive theory of multimedia learning (Mayer {\&} Moreno), and the use of external representations to help manage CL in Computer Supported Collaborative Learning environments (Van Bruggen, Kirschner, {\&} Jochems). {\textcopyright}2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {Brainsketching is an idea generation technique, based on brainwriting, that uses sketching as the primary means of recording ideas. During brainsketching, participants sketch their ideas individually on large sheets of paper pasted on the wall. After a few minutes, the participants explain their idea sketches, switch places and continue sketching. Usually, about five such rounds of idea sketching take place. In an experimental set-up brainsketching was compared to brainstorming. Linkography was used as a method for analyzing the process characteristics of both techniques. Results show that during brainstorming, participants generated significantly more ideas, and that during brainsketching participants generated significantly more connections with earlier ideas. Also, during brainsketching participants made more incremental connections while maintaining a similar level of ‘wild leap' connections. Conclusion of this study was that brainsketching does not necessarily provide a better idea generation process; rather, it provides a different process, which may serve different purposes. Some steps towards further development of the brainsketching technique are indicated. Suggestions are provided for stimulating the group to reflect on their ideas. Finally, some suggestions are made for applying the brainsketching technique with groups of nondesigners, mainly directed at removing the participants' hesitation to draw in public},

abstract = {This paper redefines design based on the realization that communi- cation design, first and foremost, concerns meaning. It distinguishes between intended, constructed, and received or re-constructed meaning. Design is the activity that directs the process, and enables the correspondence between the three. By focusing on received meaning, it shifts design paradigm, from a preoccupation with designing objects for certain uses to focusing on the cognitive processes that underlie the reception of those designs. It defines designs as cognitive interfaces that enable reconstruction of intend- ed meanings. Its approach stresses the semiotic relations between perception and meaning construction to explain the perceptual and cultural codes involved in communication. The position presented here redirects the perceived ground for design away from objects themselves, as independent from mind, toward the conceptual characteristics these objects embody as a means of communication. It redefines designs from finite, fixed objects of aesthetic and practical consideration to semiotic interfaces enabling the reconstruction of meaning by receivers. It challenges the fixation of designs on aesthetic justification by shifting attention to the semiotic functions of cognitive interfaces. Thus, design is approached as a semiotic phenomenon, which is dependent on cognitive and developmental processes, and which coexists with cultural codifications comprising collective and individual environ- ments. Design draws upon the concept of diagrammatic reasoning, and proposes that all designs be regarded as diagrams of mental maps of individual and collective cultures. Its focus on the diagram- matic nature of knowledge presentation necessitates the emergence of intelligent design as informed by a rational selection and a combining of visual syntax to induce specific inferences followed by subsequent behaviors. Communication designers historically have not had adequate rational tools to bridge the gap between meaning and design decisions at the level of design form manipulation. The reliance on aesthetics and style is symptomatic of this gap. This paper demonstrates the possibility of bridging that gap.},

abstract = {In 1974, Baddeley and Hitch proposed a three-component model of working memory. Over the years, this has been successful in giving an integrated account not only of data from normal adults, but also neuropsychological, developmental and neuroimaging data. There are, however, a number of phenomena that are not readily captured by the original model. These are outlined here and a fourth component to the model, the episodic buffer, is proposed. It comprises a limited capacity system that provides temporary storage of information held in a multimodal code, which is capable of binding information from the subsidiary systems, and from long-term memory, into a unitary episodic representation. Conscious awareness is assumed to be the principal mode of retrieval from the buffer. The revised model differs from the old principally in focussing attention on the processes of integrating information, rather than on the isolation of the subsystems. In doing so, it provides a better basis for tackling the more complex aspects of executive control in working memory. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {Categorical models of emotions posit neurally and physiologically distinct human basic emotions. We tested this assumption by using multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) to classify brain activity patterns of 6 basic emotions (disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, anger, and surprise) in 3 experiments. Emotions were induced with short movies or mental imagery during functional magnetic resonance imaging. MVPA accurately classified emotions induced by both methods, and the classification generalized from one induction condition to another and across individuals. Brain regions contributing most to the classification accuracy included medial and inferior lateral prefrontal cortices, frontal pole, precentral and postcentral gyri, precuneus, and posterior cingulate cortex. Thus, specific neural signatures across these regions hold representations of different emotional states in multimodal fashion, independently of how the emotions are induced. Similarity of subjective experiences between emotions was associated with similarity of neural patterns for the same emotions, suggesting a direct link between activity in these brain regions and the subjective emotional experience.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Automatic emotion recognition is one of the most challenging tasks. To detect emotion from nonstationary EEG signals, a sophisticated learning algorithm that can represent high-level abstraction is required. This study proposes the utilization of a deep learning network (DLN) to discover unknown feature correlation between input signals that is crucial for the learning task. The DLN is implemented with a stacked autoencoder (SAE) using hierarchical feature learning approach. Input features of the network are power spectral densities of 32-channel EEG signals from 32 subjects. To alleviate overfitting problem, principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to extract the most important components of initial input features. Furthermore, covariate shift adaptation of the principal components is implemented to minimize the nonstationary effect of EEG signals. Experimental results show that the DLN is capable of classifying three different levels of valence and arousal with accuracy of 49.52{\%} and 46.03{\%}, respectively. Principal component based covariate shift adaptation enhances the respective classification accuracy by 5.55{\%} and 6.53{\%}. Moreover, DLN provides better performance compared to SVM and naive Bayes classifiers.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Individuals at risk for, and diagnosed with, bipolar disorder (BD) appear to have heightened levels of creativity. Although inspiration is creativity, the ways in which individuals appraise and respond emotionally to inspiration in BD remain unexplored. METHOD: The present study reports on a new measure of inspiration (External and Internal Sources of Inspiration Scale--EISI). The reliability and validity of EISI were explored along with associations between EISI and BD risk. RESULTS: Among a cross-national student sample (N = 708) 5 inspiration factors were derived from EISI (self, other, achievement, prosocial and external inspiration). Reliability, concurrent validity and convergent/divergent validity were good. Total EISI and all subscales were associated with increased positive rumination, and total EISI and the achievement EISI subscale were associated with impulsivity. Total EISI, self and prosocial EISI subscales were independently associated with BD risk and current mania symptoms. CONCLUSION: This new measure of inspiration is multidimensional, reliable and valid. Findings suggest that self and prosocial focused inspiration are particularly associated with risk for BD after controlling for current manic symptoms. Future studies in clinical populations may illuminate the relationships between inspiration and creativity in BD.},

We explain our approach by arguing from the somaesthetic perspective. We propose the concept of interaction gestalt, as a way to achieve those three ways of thinking in design. We then propose a set of interaction gestalt attributes that can be used in designing aesthetic interac- tions.

abstract = {Empathy, as defined in behavioral sciences, expresses the ability of human beings to recognize, understand and react to emotions, attitudes and beliefs of others. The lack of an operational definition of empathy makes it difficult to measure it. In this paper, we address two related problems in automatic behavioral analysis: the design of the annotation protocol and the automatic recognition of empathy from spoken conversations. We propose and evaluate an annotation scheme for empathy inspired by the modal model of emotions. The annotation scheme has been evaluated on a corpus of real-life, dyadic spoken conversations. In the context of behavioral analysis, we have designed an automatic segmentation and classification systems for empathy. Given the different speech and language representations where empathy may be communicated, we have investigated features derived from the lexical and acoustic spaces. The feature development process has been designed to support both the fusion and automatic selection of relevant features from high dimensional space. The automatic classification system has been evaluated on call center conversations and performed significantly better than the baseline.},

Competing models of the latent structure of the PANAS were evaluated using confirmatory factor analysis. Regression and correlational analysis were used to determine the influence of demographic variables on PANAS scores as well as the relationship between the PANAS with measures of depression and anxiety (the HADS and the DASS).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The best-fitting model (robust comparative fit index = .94) of the latent structure of the PANAS consisted of two correlated factors corresponding to the PA and NA scales, and permitted correlated error between items drawn from the same mood subcategories (Zevon {\&} Tellegen, 1982). Demographic variables had only very modest influences on PANAS scores and the PANAS exhibited measurement invariance across demographic subgroups. The reliability of the PANAS was high, and the pattern of relationships between the PANAS and the DASS and HADS were consistent with tripartite theory.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The PANAS is a reliable and valid measure of the constructs it was intended to assess, although the hypothesis of complete independence between PA and NA must be rejected. The utility of this measure is enhanced by the provision of large-scale normative data.},

To test these relationships, the authors used a matched sample of 173 supervisor-subordinate dyads who worked full time in a state agency. Findings showed that individuals who used high levels of any of the tactics and who were politically skilled achieved more desirable supervisor ratings than did those who used the tactics but were not politically skilled. Opposite results were found when impression management usage was low. That is, individuals who were not politically skilled created a more desirable image in their supervisors' eyes than did their politically skilled counterparts when they did not use these tactics. Practical and research implications for the findings as well as directions for future research are offered.},

Based on judgments from partners and observers, three main findings were produced. First, judgments of attractiveness/vitality perceptions (compared with warmth/trustworthiness and status/resources) were the most accurate and were predominant in influencing romantic interest and decisions about further contact. Second, women were more cautious and choosy than men-women underestimated their partner's romantic interest, whereas men exaggerated it, and women were less likely to want further contact. Third, a mediational model found that women (compared with men) were less likely to want further contact because they perceived their partners as possessing less attractiveness/vitality and as falling shorter of their minimum standards of attractiveness/vitality, thus generating lower romantic interest. These novel results are discussed in terms of the mixed findings from prior research, evolutionary psychology, and the functionality of lay psychology in early mate-selection contexts.},

They used within-participants designs on several tasks, including having participants adjust the object's size to 'look best'. We examined visual size preference in 2AFC tasks with explicit aesthetic instructions to choose: ''which of each pair you like best''.We also used both within- and between-participants conditions to investigate the possible role of demand characteristics. In experiments 1 and 2, participants saw all possible image pairs depicting the same object at six different sizes for twelve real-world objects that varied in physical size. Significant effects of known physical size were present, regardless of whether participants made judgments about a single object (the between-participants design) or about all objects intermixed (the within-participants design). Experiment 3 showed a reduced effect when the amount of image detail present at different visual sizes was kept constant by posterizing the images. The results are discussed in terms of ecological biases on aesthetic preferences. {\textcopyright} 2011 a Pion publication.},

For all five, we show high agreement between Mechani- cal Turk non-expert annotations and existing gold standard labels provided by expert label- ers. For the task of affect recognition, we also show that using non-expert labels for training machine learning algorithms can be as effec- tive as using gold standard annotations from experts. We propose a technique for bias correction that significantly improves annota- tion quality on two tasks. We conclude that many large labeling tasks can be effectively designed and carried out in this method at a fraction of the usual expense.},

abstract = {For many years, theories of collaborative learning tended to focus on how individuals function in a group. More recently, the focus has shifted so that the group itself has become the unit of analysis. In terms of empirical research, the initial goal was to establish whether and under what circumstances collaborative learning was more effective than learning alone. Researchers controlled several independent variables (size of the group, composition of the group, nature of the task, communication media, and so on). However, these variables interacted with one another in a way that made it almost impossible to establish causal links between the conditions and the effects of collaboration. Hence, empirical studies have more recently started to focus less on establishing parameters for effective collaboration and more on trying to understand the role which such variables play in mediating interaction. In this chapter, we argue that this shift to a more process-oriented account requires new tools for analysing and modelling interactions.},

In the twentieth century, the first and second orders of design were central in the establishment of graphic and industrial design. In the early years of the twenty-first century, the third and fourth orders of design were related to interactions and environments. This description can be associated with different phases of the Industrial Revolution: the first two phases allowed the transition from a farming and feudal society to an industrial and capitalist one, a third one was related to a post-industrial or services society. The Fourth Industrial Revolution presents the Internet, 3D printers and genetic algorithms as the main technical achievements and green energies as the energy source. It is related to computers, software, artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things and machine learning. These technological forces will create the space for the most important design jobs of the future.},

The purpose of this paper is to examine conceptual and methodological issues concerning the assessment of vicarious emotional responding and to present data from a series of multimethod studies on the assessment of empathy-related reactions and their association with prosocial behavior. The findings presented are consistent with several conclusions: (a) In some contexts, physiological, facial, and self-report indexes can be useful markers of vicarious emotional responses, (b) other-oriented sympathetic responding is positively related to prosocial behavior (particularly altruism) whereas personal distress reactions sometimes are associated with low levels of helping, and (c) physiological arousal is higher for personal distress than sympathetic reactions.},

Three hundred and eighty nine Chinese college students, ranging in age from 17 to 25 (M = 20. 39), completed the emotional and social loneliness scale, the self-esteem scale, the satisfaction with life scale and measure of social support. Structural equation modeling showed full mediation effects of loneliness and self-esteem between social support and life satisfaction. The final model also revealed a significant path from social support through loneliness and self-esteem to life satisfaction. Furthermore, a multi-group analysis found that the paths did not differ across sexes.

abstract = {Machine learning is one of the most important and successful techniques in contemporary computer science. It involves the statistical inference of models (such as classifiers) from data. It is often conceived in a very impersonal way, with algorithms working autonomously on passively collected data. However, this viewpoint hides considerable human work of tuning the algorithms, gathering the data, and even deciding what should be modeled in the first place. Examining machine learning from a human-centered perspective includes explicitly recognising this human work, as well as reframing machine learning workflows based on situated human working practices, and exploring the coadaptation of humans and systems. A human-centered understanding of machine learning in human context can lead not only to more usable machine learning tools, but to new ways of framing learning computationally. This workshop will bring together researchers to discuss these issues and suggest future research questions aimed at creating a human-centered approach to machine learning.},

A Predictive Model of Self-Managing Work Team Effectiveness.
his paper tests a theoretically-driven model of self-managing work team effectiveness. Self-managing work team effectiveness is defined as both high performance and employee quality of work life. Drawing on different theoretical perspectives including work design, self-leadership, sociotechnical, and participative management, four categories of variables are theorized to predict self-managing work team effectiveness: group task design, encouraging supervisor behaviors, group characteristics, and employee involvement context. Data is collected from both a set of self-managing and traditionally managed teams from a large telephone company, and the model is tested with structural equations modeling. Support is found for hypotheses concerning group task design, group characteristics, and employee involvement context, but not encouraging supervisory behaviors.

An Investigation of Team Information Processing in Service Teams: Exploring the Link between Teams and Customers. Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, Vol. 31, No. 4, 409-424 
In an effort to satisfy the needs of increasingly knowledgeable and demanding customers, many organizations are implementing teams in customer contact positions. Unfortunately, stifled information flows and poor communication often impede their effectiveness. To help managers build more effective teams, the authors develop and test a model of team information processing that includes both antecedents (information acquisition, team norms, team size, and team longevity) and outcomes (customer satisfaction with service).Data collected from 61 health care teams, as well as from 1,598 patients served by these teams, are used to investigate the hypothesized relationships between variables. Partial support for the model is provided. Based on these findings, implications for researchers and practitioners are offered.

Cooperation, Competition, and Team Performance - Toward a Contingency Approach.
This study examined whether the relationship between reward structure and team performance is contingent upon task dimension, team composition, and individual performance level. Seventy-five four-person teams engaged in a simulated interactive task in which reward structure was manipulated. A competitive structure enhanced one task dimension, speed, whereas a cooperative structure enhanced accuracy. Teams with extroverted and agreeable members performed better under the cooperative structure, whereas teams low on these orientations performed better under the competitive structure. Finally, reward structure had more impact on team members with low performance.

The Effect of Reward Structures on the Performance of Cross-Functional Product Development Teams. Journal of Marketing
This study examines the effect of reward structures on the performance of cross-functional product development teams. Results suggest that when it is easy to evaluate individual performances, position-based differential rewards lead to greater satisfaction. For long and complex projects, process-based rewards have a negative effect and outcome-based rewards have a positive effect on performance. For risky projects and highly competitive or relatively stable industries, a nonlinear and monotonically decreasing relationship exists between outcome-based rewards and product quality

This study examined the relationship between R{\{}{\&}{\}}amp;D team climate and team performance in a developing context, Korea. Given the fragmented results of existing studies in advanced countries, which explored largely the effects of individual dimensions of team climate on team performance, this study focused on the interaction effects among multiple dimensions of team climate. The interaction effects can produce seemingly contradictory or paradoxical bivariate associations between each climate dimension and team performance.
Both bivariate and multivariate analyses, using data from 80 R{\{}{\&}{\}}amp;D project teams in both government-sponsored research institutes and private R{\{}{\&}{\}}amp;D centres in Korea, revealed the following results.
1. Four dimensions of R{\{}{\&}{\}}amp;D team climate?autonomy, cohesiveness, change orientation, work pressure?were not positively associated with team performance. Rather, autonomy was found to have a significant negative relationship.
2. Interaction effects of each team climate dimension were partially borne out. When the change orientation or work pressure of a team was high, autonomy had a positive impact on team performance. Otherwise, autonomous team climate deteriorated performance of the team. However, interaction effects between cohesiveness and change orientation or work pressure were not found significant.
3. There appeared three clusters of R{\{}{\&}{\}}amp;D teams with similar climate characteristics. Teams with high autonomy but a low change orientation exhibited a lower level of performance than the other two clusters?one with low autonomy but high change orientation and work pressure, and the other with a medium level of autonomy and change orientation.
The results implied that a holistic team climate, as well as an individual aspect of climate, had a significant impact on team performance. A configuration approach considering interaction effects among various climate aspects would be beneficial for the development of high performing R{\{}{\&}{\}}amp;D teams.

Effects Over Time

Group efficacy and group effectiveness - The effects of group efficacy over time on group performance and development. SMALL GROUP RESEARCH, Vol. 34 No. 1
Group efficacy is an emerging construct that has great potential for small group performance. Several studies have linked group efficacy to increased productivity. However, few studies have examined the relationship between group efficacy and other group variables that contribute to long-term group productivity. This study addresses the relationship between group efficacy and other group variables. Specifically, it examines the relationships between group efficacy and group viability, personal learning and development, satisfaction with leadership opportunities, and the ability to work independently within the group. Results suggest that group efficacy has a beneficial effect on group dynamics and overall group effectiveness. Groups with higher levels of group efficacy rated higher on group viability, learning and self-development while within the group, and opportunities for individual autonomy. Group efficacy was not found to have an impact on satisfaction with leadership opportunities. Implications of these findings and suggestions for future research are addressed.

Building Commitment, Attachment, and Trust in Strategic Decision-Making Teams: The Role of Procedural Justice. The Academy of Management Journal, Vol. 38, No. 1 (Feb., 1995), pp. 60-84
This study examined how decision-making procedures can facilitate the positive attitudes necessary for cooperative relations in decision-making teams. We hypothesized that consideration of member input and members' influence on a decision affect their perceptions of procedural fairness and consequently, their commitment to the decision, attachment to the group, and trust in its leader. An experiment involving intact management teams supported these hypotheses and indicated that perceived fairness partially mediated the impact of procedures on commitment, attachment, and trust.

Suggestion to

- use integrative dependency models (structural equation modeling for analysis)
- focus on moderator effects
- analyze curvilinear relationships (e.g. norms, team size, homogeneity)

Assessing Group Efficacy. Comparing Three Methods of Measurement. Small Group Research, Vol. 35, No. 2, 158-173 
Two hundred eighty-two undergraduate students (94 groups) participated in a laboratory study designed to compare three methods of assessing group efficacy: an aggregate of self-efficacy perceptions, an aggregate of individual perceptions of group efficacy, and a consensual approach. Findings indicate that the three methods of measuring group efficacy do not differ in their capacity to discriminate high and moderate task-difficulty conditions nor do they differ in terms of their consistency, the magnitude of their relationship with goals, or the degree to which they are affected by performance. Findings suggest that any of the three methods can be applied when studying the effects of group efficacy, at least for tasks with low interdependence.},

We conduct large-scale, randomized human-subject experiments to examine whether laypeople's trust in a model, measured in terms of both the frequency with which they revise their predictions to match those of the model and their self-reported levels of trust in the model, varies depending on the model's stated accuracy on held-out data and on its observed accuracy in practice. We find that people's trust in a model is affected by both its stated accuracy and its observed accuracy, and that the effect of stated accuracy can change depending on the observed accuracy. Our work relates to recent research on interpretable machine learning, but moves beyond the typical focus on model internals, exploring a different component of the machine learning pipeline.},

abstract = {One popular technique in the study of human recognition memory involves the elicitation of remember and know judgments and the attribution of those judgments to qualitative states of memory retrieval. An alternative view, reviewed here, implicates quantitative, but not qualitative, differences in evidence as the basis for those two judgments. That theory makes two clear and testable predictions: that of criterion shifts in "remembering" and that of isodiscriminability across different response sets. In this experiment, the makeup of the distractor set in a recognition test is shown to influence overall recognition criterion and also rates of "remember" responses. The second portion of the article demonstrates how A' is a poor choice of a measure to test the prediction of isodiscriminability. When this measure is corrected (Equation 7) to make it more consistent with current knowledge about the receiver-operating characteristic in recognition memory, it reveals that there is no difference in discriminability between "remember" and all positive responses.},

To gain insight into this phenomenon, we propose the concept ‘decisive constraints' based on a review of current, but dispersed, studies into creativity constraints. We build decisive constraints on two definitional conditions related to radical decision-making and creative turning points. To test our concept analytically and ensure its relevance to creative practice, we apply the two definitional conditions to three media fa{\c{c}}ade installation projects in which our interaction design research lab has been involved. In accord with insights from these case analyses, we argue that decisive constraints may inform current research into design processes and act as a creative resource for practitioners, not only in interaction design but, we assume, also across related creative ...},

Its processes have been studied in artists and athletes, applied to education and business, and explored in pursuits as varied as spirituality and internet use. As more analysis is done on optimal states of being, the more interest flow gathers as a focus of inquiry. In Advances in Flow Research, a panel of experts expands on Csikszentmihalyis classic flow model and opens out key concepts. Contributors address ongoing questions regarding the conditions and components of flow, and consider various methods for measurement and assessment. Current findings are included on flow-related cognitive and personality issues, and the relation of flow to happiness and other affective states. And readers are introduced to emerging areas of study, including possible contributions of flow to negative behavior. Among the topics covered: Affective, cognitive, and performance-related consequences of flow. Psychophysiological correlates of flow experience. Understanding the autotelic personality. Integrating flow theory and cognitive evaluation theory. Flow in non-achievement situations. The dark side of flow.

The results have been distilled into five consistent questionnaires using semantic differential scales. We report reliability and validity indicators based on several empirical studies that used these questionnaires. It is our hope that these questionnaires can be used by robot developers to monitor their progress.

Using a cognitive style index instrument, 104 university freshmen (48 males and 56 females) were classified into the four type groups of male analytic, male intuitive, female analytic, and female intuitive. Each participant was then asked to execute two design tasks: associate word and image ideas (ideational process) and develop a storyboard (ideational outcome). Four experts evaluated outcomes in terms of creativity, structure, and drawing skill. Results show that larger numbers of words and images correlate with good word and image ideas and that analytic females exhibited the greatest level of ideation and intuitive males exhibited the least. {\textcopyright}2014 The Author(s).},

abstract = {Many approaches in generalized zero-shot learning rely on cross-modal mapping between the image feature space and the class embedding space. As labeled images are expensive, one direction is to augment the dataset by generating either images or image features. However, the former misses fine-grained details and the latter requires learning a mapping associated with class embeddings. In this work, we take feature generation one step further and propose a model where a shared latent space of image features and class embeddings is learned by modality-specific aligned variational autoencoders. This leaves us with the required discriminative information about the image and classes in the latent features, on which we train a softmax classifier. The key to our approach is that we align the distributions learned from images and from side-information to construct latent features that contain the essential multi-modal information associated with unseen classes. We evaluate our learned latent features on several benchmark datasets, i.e. CUB, SUN, AWA1 and AWA2, and establish a new state of the art on generalized zero-shot as well as on few-shot learning. Moreover, our results on ImageNet with various zero-shot splits show that our latent features generalize well in large-scale settings.},

This article summarizes recent evidence indicating that regular exercises in self-regulation can produce broad improvements in self-regulation (like strengthening a muscle), making people less vulnerable to ego depletion. Furthermore, it shows that ego depletion moderates the effects of many traits on behavior, particularly such that wide differences in socially disapproved motivations produce greater differences in behavior when ego depletion weakens the customary inner restraints.

abstract = {The paradox of modern dating is that online platforms provide more opportunities to find a romantic partner than ever before, but people are nevertheless more likely to be single. We hypothesized the existence of a rejection mind-set: The continued access to virtually unlimited potential partners makes people more pessimistic and rejecting. Across three studies, participants immediately started to reject more hypothetical and actual partners when dating online, cumulating on average in a decrease of 27{\%} in chance on acceptance from the first to the last partner option. This was explained by an overall decline in satisfaction with pictures and perceived dating success. For women, the rejection mind-set also resulted in a decreasing likelihood of having romantic matches. Our findings suggest that people gradually “close off” from mating opportunities when online dating.},

@article{Busso2009,
abstract = {—During expressive speech, the voice is enriched to convey not only the intended semantic message but also the emotional state of the speaker. The pitch contour is one of the important properties of speech that is affected by this emotional modulation. Although pitch features have been commonly used to recognize emotions, it is not clear what aspects of the pitch contour are the most emotionally salient. This paper presents an analysis of the statistics derived from the pitch contour. First, pitch features derived from emotional speech samples are compared with the ones derived from neutral speech, by using symmetric Kullback–Leibler distance. Then, the emotionally discriminative power of the pitch features is quantified by comparing nested logistic regression models. The results indicate that gross pitch contour statistics such as mean, maximum, minimum, and range are more emotionally prominent than features describing the pitch shape. Also, analyzing the pitch statistics at the utterance level is found to be more accurate and robust than analyzing the pitch statistics for shorter speech regions (e.g., voiced segments). Finally, the best features are selected to build a binary emotion detection system for distinguishing between emotional versus neutral speech. A new two-step approach is proposed. In the first step, reference models for the pitch features are trained with neutral speech, and the input features are contrasted with the neutral model. In the second step, a fitness measure is used to assess whether the input speech is similar to, in the case of neutral speech, or different from, in the case of emotional speech, the reference models. The proposed approach is tested with four acted emotional databases spanning different emotional categories, recording settings, speakers and languages. The results show that the recognition accuracy of the system is over 77{\%} just with the pitch features (baseline 50{\%}). When compared to conventional classification schemes, the proposed approach performs better in terms of both accuracy and robustness.},

@misc{Nicolette2008,
abstract = {It is a commonplace that iteration length should be set according to release cycle length. I disagree; I think the two cycles should be decoupled. Short iterations provide more-frequent feedback from customers than long iterations and afford the team more opportunities to reflect and improve their work practices. Shorter cycles result in a "heartbeat" that occurs frequently enough to be meaningful. Short cycles naturally prevent the team from creating work items that are tediously large, with no "success" point to be had until a great deal of work has been done. These benefits apply even when the release cycle is long.

Benefits

1. Rapid response to changes in priority without disrupting work in process. It's not unusual for the Product Owner or Customer or Proxy to change priorities or add features in mid-iteration. This can be managed more cleanly if iterations are short enough that the changes may be made in the next iteration instead, since the regular pulse of iterative work need not be disrupted.
2. Problem detection. Mature agile teams recognize process smells and act on them immediately. At the moment, however, most teams using agile methods are still on the learning curve and they haven't reached a level of maturity with agile development that lets them depend on their noses. They need to track trends in project metrics to recognize problems. Given that it takes 3 data points to make a a trend and that project data are collected once per iteration, the implication is that shorter iterations expose problems faster.
3. Scope management. It's easier to move backlog items around when they are small than when they are large. Longer iterations tend to result in larger User Stories. When the Product Owner needs to change the priorities of backlog items, the impact of any given change is greater when the User Stories are larger. Shorter iterations tend to result in smaller User Stories. Following the INVEST principles, the User Stories will be easier for the Product Owner to reprioritize.
4. Iteration planning and tracking. The larger User Stories that usually come from long iterations often require decomposition into "tasks" to break the work down into bite-sized pieces. The tasks then have to be tracked throughout the iteration just so that the team can understand the status of all the Stories, either using a kanban-like system or an iteration burn chart. Many teams pause to re-estimate individual tasks that remain in incomplete status each day. All this internal process overhead can be eliminated by running short iterations so that User Stories are, themselves, small units of work and people can follow the status of the iteration in a simpler way.
5. A foundation for moving to an iterationless process. An iterative approach retains some of the natural overhead of a waterfall process even when we go to some pains to remove it. A cumulative flow diagram may expose this overhead in the form of "lead time" from the start to the end of each iteration. As teams I've worked with have squeezed their iteration length as far down as they could manage, I've noticed that they were able to eliminate significant amounts of this overhead. The shorter the iteration, the less process overhead is needed to keep things on course.

On the other hand, the discipline of working in timeboxed iterations is the source of some of the value-add of the agile approach, including frequent and regularly-scheduled demonstrations and retrospectives, a consistent schedule for delivering incremental results, frequent opportunities for customer feedback, and the sense of a "heartbeat" or "pulse" that seems to keep teams engaged over the long haul. Therefore, it seems reasonable to expect short iterations can provide a low-pain transition to a very lightweight iterationless process without making the mistake of "throwing out the baby with the bathwater" by dropping the value-add aspects of timeboxing the work, as some teams unfortunately have done when adopting an iterationless process.

A common mistake is to assume any and all practices the team had associated with "iterations" should be discarded when they move to an iterationless process. We do well to separate the concept of "iterations" from the specific value-add practices that are commonly associated with agile development, and look for ways to reduce process overhead while preserving beneficial practices.
Potential downsides

Some people have experienced problems with short iterations. 


Mishkin Berteig, proponent of short iterations, also mentions some potential downsides:

* "Intensity of work can lead to burnout." I think this is a question of how the team chooses to work. Short cycles don't necessarily translate into higher intensity. It can be done in such a way that short iterations only mean smaller timeboxes; that is, you commit to deliver less work per timebox. There needn't be any difference in "intensity." Other agile principles (notably "sustainable pace") are designed to prevent burnout.
* "Strategic thinking can be hard to fit into the schedule." Strategic thinking isn't an iteration-by-iteration matter. Iterations are tactical. Strategic thinking is...well, not tactical. This sounds like a management problem rather than a characteristic of short iterations as such.
* "Overhead tasks that must be done every iteration take a larger proportion of the time in the iteration." This sounds like another issue that boils down to how the team chooses to work. I've observed an interesting effect of squeezing down the iteration length: People "discover" certain overhead tasks were never really necessary in the first place, and stop doing them. They end up doing only what is necessary, which is another way to say they eliminate waste from their process. In fact, this observation leads me to disagree respectfully with Jim Shore's observations in a Java Ranch discussion that longer iterations are less stressful and that longer iterations work better for experienced agile teams. I don't think we want more time for iteration planning; I think we want less iteration planning. I'm for ever shorter iterations, vanishing to none as we move to a customer pull approach with single-piece (read: single feature) flow.
* "Waiting for resources or people outside of the team can make it more likely for work to span iterations." This is an organizational constraint. It isn't practical to try and run iterations shorter than the organization can handle. When you do that, they aren't really "iterations" because it isn't possible to deliver results that quickly; the organization can't absorb the results. To go further than this requires us to address the organizational constraints. I wouldn't assume shorter iterations are impossible because of a temporary organizational constraint - and they're all temporary, if you really want them to be. Easy? No one said that. But if organizational change were easy, it wouldn't be so much fun, would it?},

==
a{\{}{\_}{\}}performance
The subjective
measurement of performance consisted of two items. Participants
were asked to rate on a 5-point scale how productive they thought
their team was (1 = not productive at all to 5 = very productive)
and howwell they thought they hadworked together as a group (1 =
very poor to 5 = very good).
==
a{\{}{\_}{\}}satisfaction
Professional growth of group members
was measured by two items. Participants were asked to indicate on
a 5-point scale how much technical knowledge they had learned
from the group project (1 = not much at all to 5 = very much) and
how much the group project had helped them to understand how to
work in a team environment (1 = not much at all to 5 = very much).
===
However, recent studies have
suggested that group-level task and social cohesion constructs are
more appropriate for research that investigates the relationship
between group cohesion and group performance because (a) the
limited number of studies with non?sporting teams generally found
good support for the task-social distinction but not for the
group-individual distinction (Carless {\{}{\&}{\}}amp; DePaola, 2000; Dyce {\{}{\&}{\}}amp;
Cornell, 1996), and (b) group-level task and social cohesion are at
the same level of analysis as group performance (Gully et al.,
1995).},

abstract = {Abstract {\$}\backslash{\$}nCreativity research has moved from an almost exclusive emphasis on the creative person towards a more balanced inquiry that centers on both individual difference issues and questions about the nature of creative products and the conditions that facilitate their creation. Over 30 years of research show that product creativity can be reliably and validly assessed based on the consensus of experts. The Consensual Assessment Technique ({\{}CAT){\}} proposes that independent raters familiar with a product domain, persons who have not conferred with one another or received special training, are best able to decide whether one product is more creative than another. Although product creativity may be difficult to characterize, it is something that people can recognize and agree upon when they see it.},

abstract = {This study explored the possibilities to design interactions that evoke user interest. On the basis of appraisal theory, it was predicted that interest is evoked by a combined appraisal of novelty-complexity and coping potential. Because the role of novelty-complexity is well-documented (i.e. a product must be appraised as novel and/or complex to be interesting), the study focused on the role of coping potential: the degree to which one appraises oneself to have sufficient skills, knowledge, and resources to deal with an event. Two workshops investigated how the interest appraisal manifests in the context of human-product interaction in terms of appraisal questions and related product qualities. The findings were used to develop three prototypes of interactive music players. These were identical in terms of appearance, but different in terms of coping requirements during product use. The main study measured the appraisals and emotions of people using the prototypes, using both self-report and behavioral measures. The results indicated that along with novelty-complexity, a high level of appraised coping potential is necessary for experiencing interest. When coping potential was appraised as low, the respondents experienced negative emotions such as annoyance instead of interest.},

The present study thus provides a systematic review of the psychometric properties of these scales. This review included articles that aimed at either developing an SNS engagement scale or providing a systematic test of the psychometric properties of the scale. We conducted keyword-based searches of several broad multidisciplinary databases, along with reference list searches and article citation searches. These search strategies yielded a total of 14 reports, revealing validation evidence for 12 SNS engagement scales among 13,861 participants from 11 countries. There was mixed evidence for the various types of validity tests, with some scales having been validated more rigorously with multiple studies and samples while others having not yet been systematically validated. Sampling and acquiescence biases were also present for some scales. The present review provides recommendations for researchers intending to study SNS engagement. Although the literature search was multi-faceted, it may conceivably have missed studies that provided less rigorous validity evidence. Overall, this study contributes to evaluating and strengthening the methodological foundations of SNS research.},

@article{Cikara2014b,
abstract = {Despite its early origins and adaptive functions, empathy is not inevitable; people routinely fail to empathize with others, especially members of different social or cultural groups. In five experiments, we systematically explore how social identity, functional relations between groups, competitive threat, and perceived entitativity contribute to intergroup empathy bias: the tendency not only to empathize less with out-group relative to in-group members, but also to feel pleasure in response to their pain (and pain in response to their pleasure). When teams are set in direct competition, affective responses to competition-irrelevant events are characterized not only by less empathy toward out-group relative to in-group members, but also by increased counter-empathic responses: Schadenfreude and Gl{\"{u}}ckschmerz (Experiment 1). Comparing responses to in-group and out-group targets against responses to unaffiliated targets in this competitive context suggests that intergroup empathy bias may be better characterized by out-group antipathy rather than extraordinary in-group empathy (Experiment 2). We also find that intergroup empathy bias is robust to changes in relative group standing-feedback indicating that the out-group has fallen behind (Experiment 3a) or is no longer a competitive threat (Experiment 3b) does not reduce the bias. However, reducing perceived in-group and out-group entitativity can significantly attenuate intergroup empathy bias (Experiment 4). This research establishes the boundary conditions of intergroup empathy bias and provides initial support for a more integrative framework of group-based empathy. {\textcopyright}2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Although certain characteristics of human faces are broadly considered more attractive (e.g., symmetry, averageness), people also routinely disagree with each other on the relative attractiveness of faces. That is, to some significant degree, beauty is in the "eye of the beholder." Here, we investigate the origins of these individual differences in face preferences using a twin design, allowing us to estimate the relative contributions of genetic and environmental variation to individual face attractiveness judgments or face preferences. We first show that individual face preferences (IP) can be reliably measured and are readily dissociable from other types of attractiveness judgments (e.g., judgments of scenes, objects). Next, we show that individual face preferences result primarily from environments that are unique to each individual. This is in striking contrast to individual differences in face identity recognition, which result primarily from variations in genes [1]. We thus complete an etiological double dissociation between two core domains of social perception (judgments of identity versus attractiveness) within the same visual stimulus (the face). At the same time, we provide an example, rare in behavioral genetics, of a reliably and objectively measured behavioral characteristic where variations are shaped mostly by the environment. The large impact of experience on individual face preferences provides a novel window into the evolution and architecture of the social brain, while lending new empirical support to the long-standing claim that environments shape individual notions of what is attractive.},

@article{Flower1977,
abstract = {One of the earliest collaborative precursors to Flower and Hayes' cognitive process model, this essay presents heuristics and problem-solving as ways to address the morass of the same old same old: "our basic methods of teaching writing are the same ones English academic were using in the seventeenth century" (449). Flower and Hayes argue that while practitioners do well to get students analyzing writing-as-product, there has not been especially much to illuminate aspects of process. Process, they write, has been left "up to inspiration" (449). They invoke heuristics much in the same light Janice Lauer does in 1970 with her brief essay and related bibliography, arguing that heuristics are "a kind of shorthand for cognitive operations...they give the writer self-conscious access to some of the thinking techniques that normally constitute 'inspiration.'" (452). If we were use a line chart to illustrate a continuum between algorithmic approaches to invention and aleatory approaches to invention, with heuristics as an intervening term, Flower and Hayes' variety of heuristics would probably be located herex, nestled among the algorithm-heuristic hybrids. Their cognitive process model--circa 1980--resides in this same area, an area regarded with suspicion by many of the critics of the cognitive process, so suspiciously, in fact, that doubters tend to glide across it like they would Lock Ness:

{\textless}--algorithm-------x----heuristic------------aleatory--{\textgreater}

Still, Flower and Hayes make a positive argument, sharing their goal-directed heuristics as "an alternative to trial and error" (450) and as an approach that views writing as a "thinking problem, rather than an arrangement problem" (450). The thick teleology governing this approach is something of a concern to Berthoff (for all of the reasons she points out in "The Problem with Problem-Solving." Flower and Hayes offer heuristics as a fourth alternative to the three pervasive strategies for writing: 1.) formulism and prescription (as comes, oftentimes, from text books), 2.) inspiration (kept mysterious and often following Romantic misconceptions), and 3.) writer's block (nothing works). Heuristics offer "problem-solving techniques." Like the journalist's "Who? What? When? Where? Why?" (451), heuristics "give the writer a repertory of alternatives and the power of choice" (452). Their problem-solving strategy is derived from protocol analysis; researchers focused on two key tasks: "(1) to generate ideas in language and then (2) to construct those ideas into a written structure adapted to the needs of a reader and the goals of the writer" (452). Consider this a moment where the proposition takes on a mechanistic character. The heuristics are broken down as follows. 
Each item includes an explanation:
1. Plan
1.1 Set Up a Goal
1.2 Find Operators

2. Generating Ideas in Words
2.1 Play Your Thoughts
2.1.1 Stage a Scenario
2.1.2 Play Out an Analogy
2.1.3 Rest and Incubate
2.2 Push Your Ideas
2.2.1 Find a Cue Word or Rich Bit
2.2.2 Nutshell Your Ideas and Teach Them
2.2.3 Tree Your Ideas
2.2.4 Test Your Writing Against Your Own Editor

3. Constructing For An Audience
3.1 Ends
3.1.1 Identify a Mutual End You and the Reader Share
3.1.2 Decide on Your Own Specific Ends
3.2 Roadblocks
3.3 Means
3.3.1 Develop a Rhetorical Strategy
3.3.2 Test Your Rhetorical Strategy

Flower and Hayes anticipate and answer concerns about the ordering of the heuristics: "Do writers dutifully Plan, Generate, Construct, then turn out the light with the paper done? The answer is an emphatic no. Although we have grouped these heuristics together by their function, the process of writing rarely if ever exhibits those autonomous stages textbooks describe as Gather Information, Outline, and Write. Instead, thought in writing moves in a series of non-linear jumps from one problem and procedure to another" (460). They go on to call the process "iterative," but perhaps there isn't enough here too address the ways a goal changes or the sort of writing that sets out toward a moving or undetermined end. Continuing in the spirit of positive assertions, Flower and Hayes describe writing, "like problem-solving thinking in general, [as] a performance art" (461), and they are explicitly interested in "replacing the mystique of talent and the fear of failing with the possibility of an attainable goal" (461).

"Because inspiration is always dependent on the mental preparation that went before, it often does fail for the passively expectant writer waiting for the flow of magic ideas" (451).

"In formulating our strategy in this two-part way, we have made a fundamental assumption about the composing process: namely, that it can often be divided into two complimentary but semi-autonomous processes, which we designate as generating versus constructing on one level and playing versus pushing on another" (452).

@article{Karoly1993,
annote = {Note3 self-regulation
Karoly (1993), has conducted an extensive review of self-regulation mechanisms underlying cognitive and somatic based learning in therapy and performance, and defines self-regulation as:

those processes, internal and/or transactional, that enable an individual to guide his/her goal-directed activities over time and across changing circumstances (contexts). Regulation implies modulation of thought, affect, behavior, or attention via deliberate or automated use of specific mechanisms and supportive meta-skills. The processes of self-regulation are initiated when routinized activity is impeded or when goal-directedness is otherwise made salient (e.g., the appearance of a challenge, the failure of habitual action patterns, etc). 

Self-regulation appears to be the stable element attempting to guide behavior along a specific path to a directed aim or goal. However, apart from procedural, epistemic and conceptual divergences in various models of self-regulation, basic volitional factors, such as goal setting, self-monitoring, activation and use of goals, discrepancy detection and implementation, self-evaluation, self-consequation, self-efficacy, meta-skills, boundary conditions, and self-regulation failure, characterize the process of self-regulation (Karoly, 1993). Therefore, a brief discussion of the basic tenants outlined in self-regulation models may assist in identifying key issues in improving performance.

==
Once goal setting has been developed, the ability to self-monitor becomes essential because attention to internal and external cues, through greater self-awareness, leads to faster and more appropriate control of intervention strategies. Attention to internal states (thoughts, feeling, sensations) and external states (bodily movement and environment) is a different phenomenon from attentional styles, though there is overlap between the two. Attentional styles involve the relationship of concentration and focus, or perception selection, to a dynamic environment (Zaichkowsky, 1984). Attentional styles can range from broad-external focus of attention (optimal for reading complex sport situations and assessing the environment, i.e., good anticipation skills), broad-internal focus of attention (optimal for analyzing sport within the context of strategies and plans, and for future anticipated events, i.e., quick learners), narrow-external focus of attention (able to pay attention on the necessary stimuli at the right moments with the correct responses), and narrow-internal focus of attention (ability to psyche oneself up and calm oneself down) (Nideffer, 1981). There are degrees and combinations of the aforementioned foci of attention across and within individuals. How much of these types of attentional styles, and their combinations, is a product of personality and/or trainable is still unclear, but attentional styles appear to be related to the degree of internal and external distraction (Singer et al., 1991), and the degree of conscious and automatic control an individual possesses for a given task (Hardy, Mullen, {\{}{\&}{\}}amp; Jones, 1996). That is, it is the ability of the athlete to intervene and separate important mental content from non-important derived from specific stimuli, and to know when to consciously over-ride actions or to allow automatic processes to continue. This process is governed by the skill of the individual to self-monitor effectively.},

To tackle this problem, Few-Shot Learning (FSL) is proposed. It can rapidly generalize from new tasks of limited supervised experience using prior knowledge. To fully understand FSL, we conduct a survey study. We first clarify a formal definition for FSL. Then we figure out that the unreliable empirical risk minimizer is the core issue of FSL. Based on how prior knowledge is used to deal with the core issue, we categorize different FSL methods into three perspectives: data uses the prior knowledge to augment the supervised experience, model constrains the hypothesis space by prior knowledge, and algorithm uses prior knowledge to alter the search for the parameter of the best hypothesis in the hypothesis space. Under this unified taxonomy, we provide a thorough discussion of pros and cons across different categories. Finally, we propose possible directions for FSL in terms of problem setup, techniques, applications, and theories, in the hope of providing insights to the following research.},

abstract = {The present research introduces the concept of experience-taking-the imaginative process of spontaneously assuming the identity of a character in a narrative and simulating that character's thoughts, emotions, behaviors, goals, and traits as if they were one's own. Six studies investigated the degree to which particular psychological states and features of narratives cause individuals, without instruction, to engage in experience-taking and investigated how the merger between self and other that occurs during experience-taking produces changes in self-judgments, attitudes, and behavior that align with the character's. Results from Studies 1-3 showed that being in a reduced state of self-concept accessibility while reading a brief fictional work increased-and being in a heightened state of self-concept accessibility decreased-participants' levels of experience-taking and subsequent incorporation of a character's personality trait into their self-concepts. Study 4 revealed that a first-person narrative depicting an ingroup character elicited the highest levels of experience-taking and produced the greatest change in participants' behavior, compared with versions of the narrative written in 3rd-person voice and/or depicting an outgroup protagonist. The final 2 studies demonstrated that whereas revealing a character's outgroup membership as a homosexual or African American early in a narrative inhibited experience-taking, delaying the revelation of the character's outgroup identity until later in the story produced higher levels of experience-taking, lower levels of stereotype application in participants' evaluation of the character, and more favorable attitudes toward the character's group. The implications of these findings in relation to perspective-taking, self-other overlap, and prime-to-behavior effects are discussed.},

abstract = {Metacognition, defined as active control over cognitive processes during learning, is a critical component in the development of intercultural competence. Progression through stages of intercultural development requires self-assessment, self-monitoring, predictive, planning, and reflection skills. Modern virtual learning environments now provide a level of immersion that enable meaningful practice of cultural skills, both in terms of visual and experiential fidelity. This paper discusses their potential role in intercultural training, and the use of intelligent tutoring and experience manipulation techniques to support metacognitive and intercultural development. Techniques for adapting the behaviors of virtual humans to promote cultural learning are discussed along with the role of explicit feedback. The paper concludes with several suggestions for future research, including the use of existing intercultural development metrics for evaluating learning in immersive environments and on the balance between implicit and explicit feedback to establish optimal conditions for acquiring intercultural competence.},

They were unhappy about the way in which existing theories dominated sociological research. They argued that researchers needed a method that would allow them to move from data to theory, so that new theories could emerge. Such theories would be specific to the context in which they had been developed. They would be 'grounded' in the data from which they had emerged rather than rely on analytical constructs, categories or variables from pre-existing theories. Grounded theory, therefore, was designed to open up a space for the development of new, contextualized theories. MGH083{\_}ch07.indd 69 4/25/13 1:48 PM CHAPTER 7 GROUNDED THEORY METHODOLOGY CHAPTER 7 GROUNDED THEORY METHODOLOGY 70 Since the publication of The Discovery of Grounded Theory by Glaser and Strauss in 1967, the grounded theory method has undergone a number of revisions. Most signifi cantly, Glaser and Strauss themselves parted company and proposed different ways in which grounded theory ought to be practised (see Snapshot Box 7.1 at the end of this chapter). In this chapter, I introduce the basic principles of grounded theory. This is followed by an illustration of the application of the method to the study of nurse–patient interaction. Having thus outlined the basic process of grounded theory, I identify some of the differences between the various versions of the grounded theory method. I then go on to draw attention to the limitations of grounded theory as a qualitative method for psychological research. The chapter concludes by examining what grounded theory may have to say in response to the three epistemological questions identifi ed at the end of Chapter 1.},

The authors presume that specific situational and dispositional antecedents of social anxiety operate by influencing people's motivation to impress others and their expectations of satisfactorily doing so. In contrast to drive models of anxiety but consistent with social learning theory, it is argued that the cognitive state of the individual mediates both affective arousal and behavior. The traditional inverted-–U relation between anxiety and performance is reexamined in this light. Counseling implications are considered, including the recommendation that treatments be tailored to specific types of self-presentational problems. (142 ref)},

abstract = {Whether observation of distress in others leads to empathic concern and altruistic motivation, or to personal distress and egoistic motivation, seems to depend upon the capacity for self-other differentiation and cognitive appraisal. In this experiment, behavioral measures and event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging were used to investigate the effects of perspective-taking and cognitive appraisal while participants observed the facial expression of pain resulting from medical treatment. Video clips showing the faces of patients were presented either with the instruction to imagine the feelings of the patient ("imagine other") or to imagine oneself to be in the patient's situation ("imagine self"). Cognitive appraisal was manipulated by providing information that the medical treatment had or had not been successful. Behavioral measures demonstrated that perspective-taking and treatment effectiveness instructions affected participants' affective responses to the observed pain. Hemodynamic changes were detected in the insular cortices, anterior medial cingulate cortex (aMCC), amygdala, and in visual areas including the fusiform gyrus. Graded responses related to the perspective-taking instructions were observed in middle insula, aMCC, medial and lateral premotor areas, and selectively in left and right parietal cortices. Treatment effectiveness resulted in signal changes in the perigenual anterior cingulate cortex, in the ventromedial orbito-frontal cortex, in the right lateral middle frontal gyrus, and in the cerebellum. These findings support the view that humans' responses to the pain of others can be modulated by cognitive and motivational processes, which influence whether observing a conspecific in need of help will result in empathic concern, an important instigator for helping behavior.},

However, smartphone overuse is an emerging social issue, and limited studies have objectively assessed this matter. The majority of previous studies have included surveys or behavioral observation studies. Since a previous study demonstrated an association between increased push notifications and smartphone overuse, we investigated the effects of push notifications on task performance. We detected changes in brainwaves generated by smartphone push notifications using the N200 and P300 components of event-related potential (ERP) to investigate both concentration and cognitive ability. ERP assessment indicated that, in both risk and nonrisk groups, the lowest N200 amplitude and the longest latency during task performance were found when push notifications were delivered. Compared to the nonrisk group, the risk group demonstrated lower P300 amplitudes and longer latencies. In addition, the risk group featured a higher rate of error in the Go-Nogo task, due to the negative influence of smartphone push notifications on performance in both risk and nonrisk groups. Furthermore, push notifications affected subsequent performance in the risk group.},

abstract = {Design-based research studies are conducted as iterative implementation- analysis-modification cycles, in which emerging theoretical models and pedagogically plausible activities are reciprocally tuned toward each other as a means of investigating conjectures pertaining to mechanisms underlying content teaching and learning. Yet this approach, even when resulting in empirically effective educational products, remains underconceptualized as long as researchers cannot be explicit about their craft and specifically how data analyses inform design decisions. Consequentially, design decisions may appear arbitrary, design methodology is insufficiently documented for broad dissemination, and design practice is inadequately conversant with learning-sciences perspectives. One reason for this apparent under-theorizing, I propose, is that designers do not have appropriate constructs to formulate and reflect on their own intuitive responses to students observed interactions with the media under development. Recent socio-cultural explication of epistemic artifacts as semiotic means for mathematical learners to objectify presymbolic notions (e.g., Radford, Mathematical Thinking and Learning 5(1): 3770, 2003) may offer design-based researchers intellectual perspectives and analytic tools for theorizing design improvements as responses to participants compromised attempts to build and communicate meaning with available media. By explaining these media as potential semiotic means for students to objectify their emerging understandings of mathematical ideas, designers, reciprocally, create semiotic means to objectify their own intuitive design decisions, as they build and improve these media. Examining three case studies of undergraduate students reasoning about a simple probability situation (binomial), I demonstrate how the semiotic approach illuminates the process and content of student reasoning and, so doing, explicates and possibly enhances design-based research methodology.},

There is no previous research on classifying sentiment of messages on microblogging services like Twitter. We present the results of machine learning algorithms for classifying the sentiment of Twitter messages using distant supervision. Our training data consists of Twitter messages with emoticons, which are used as noisy labels. This type of training data is abundantly available and can be obtained through automated means. We show that machine learning algorithms (Naive Bayes, Maximum Entropy, and SVM) have accuracy above 80{\%} when trained with emoticon data. This paper also describes the preprocessing steps needed in order to achieve high accuracy. The main contribution of this paper is the idea of using tweets with emoticons for distant supervised learning.},

annote = {a{\{}{\_}{\}}autonomy 
A number of researchers have attempted to develop scales for the
measurement of team-level autonomy, including Langfred (2000a) and Janz et al. (1997).
Others have measured similar concepts, such as group control (Liden et al., 1997). For the purposes
of this study, I consider the most useful scale to be an adapted version of Breaugh?s
(1985) Individual Autonomy Scale. 
I believe that in exploring the simultaneous effects of individual-
and team-level autonomy, the importance of consistency in the operationalization of
autonomy itself?at both the team and individual level?outweighs the advantages of other,
more established scales. This adapted scale uses Breaugh?s individual-level items but applies
them to the team instead of to an individual. Sample items from the adapted scale are 

?the team is free to choose the method(s) to use in carrying out teamwork? and 
?the team has control over the scheduling of teamwork.? 


In preliminary scale development conducted in a separate data
set of 133 respondents, the scale had strong discriminant validity and internal reliability. In
this data set, it had a reliability (Cronbach?s alpha) of .91.

Items:
I am free to decide how to go about getting my work done. .675 .933
I am free to choose how to carry out my work. .642 .845

@article{Sutton1997a,
abstract = {Experimental research indicates that people in face-to- face brainstorming meetings are less efficient at generat- ing ideas than when working alone. This so-called pro- ductivity loss has led many brainstorming researchers to conclude that there is overwhelming evidence for the in- effectiveness of these sessions. We question this conclu- sion because it is based on efficient idea generation as the primary effectiveness outcome and on studies that do not examine how or why organizations use brain- storming. We report a qualitative study of a product de- sign firm that uses brainstorming sessions. These ses- sions had six important consequences for this firm, its design engineers, and its clients that are not evident in the brainstorming literature, or are reported but not la- beled as effectiveness outcomes: (1) supporting the or- ganizational memory of design solutions; (2) providing skill variety for designers; (3) supporting an attitude of wisdom (acting with knowledge while doubting what one knows); (4) creating a status auction (a competition for status based on technical skill); (5) impressing clients; and (6) providing income for the firm. This study sug- gests that when brainstorming sessions are viewed in organizational context and the "effectiveness at what" and "effectiveness for whom" questions are asked, effi- ciency at idea generation may deserve no special status as an effectiveness outcome. We propose a broader per- spective for assessing brainstorming effectiveness in or- ganizations},

However, little is known about the differential performance of these three approaches to exploratory factor analysis in a small sample size scenario.

@article{Bakker2016,
abstract = {Recently, the focus of such research has shifted towards studying both the perception of and interaction with digital information at the periphery of attention, enabling peripheral interaction with computing technology (Bakker, van den Hoven, {\&} Eggen, 2015b; Edge {\&} Blackwell, 2009; Hausen, Tabard, von Thermann, Holzner, {\&} Butz, 2014; Olivera, Garc{\'{i}}a-Herranz, Haya, {\&} Llin{\'{a}}s, 2011). Despite these efforts, barely any computing devices enable peripheral interactions. With the increasing ubiquity of technology, we believe that the vision of making interactive systems available in people's periphery of attention is of growing relevance in order to seamlessly integrate computing technology into people's everyday lives and environments. To achieve this, we argue that calm technology or peripheral interaction should not be seen as an alternative to focused or implicit interaction, but as a part of a continuum of interaction possibilities corresponding with varied levels of human attention. If interactive systems could seamlessly shift between focused, peripheral and implicit interaction, users would have the flexibly to choose the level of attention they wish to devote to the interaction depending on their context, goals and desires. Such flexibility was envisioned to be part of calm technology (Weiser {\&} Brown, 1997), but current interactive systems seem to cover only two ends of the spectrum of human attention abilities, only offering scope for focused interaction and implicit interaction. This article presents the interaction-attention continuum, which is aimed at supporting interaction design researchers in facilitating Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) at different levels of attention and to enable shifts along this continuum as the user desires. The interaction-attention continuum is grounded in theories of human attention and aims to provide a cross-over between these theories and theories of HCI. The continuum aims to provide interaction design researchers and practitioners with a practical handle to view and explore interaction design from the angle of human attention. We illustrate the application of the interaction-attention continuum through four case studies on interaction design for interactive lighting systems. We conclude the article by discussing considerations for interaction design exemplified in the case studies. Interaction Design along the Interaction-Attention Continuum To seamlessly fit technology into our everyday lives, we believe it is crucial to offer interaction possibilities at various levels of attention. We start by grounding our work in attention theory. Following this, we introduce the interaction-attention continuum, review related interaction design work and discuss why it is crucial to bridge the gap between focused and implicit interaction, before continuing to present our design cases.},

Its purpose is threefold: (a) to present a nonmathmatical introduction to basic concepts associated with SEM, (b) to demonstrate basic applications of SEM using both the DOS and Windows versions of LISREL 8, as well as both the LISREL and SIMPLIS lexicons, and (c) to highlight particular features of the LISREL 8 and PRELIS 2 progams that address important caveats related to SEM analyses.

This book is intended neither as a text on the topic of SEM, nor as a comprehensive review of the many statistical funcitons available in the LISREL 8 and PRELIS 2 programs. Rather, the intent is to provide a practical guide to SEM using the LISREL approach. As such, the reader is "walked through" a diversity of SEM applications that include both factor analytic and full latent variable models, as well as a variety of data management procedures.},

annote = {p.73 Likert scales not interval-scaled but ordinal {\{}{\&}{\}}gt; use polychoric correlations!
scaling of variables can be classified either continuous (i.e., response scores represent any value within the range of possible values) or ordinal ...;
ordinal variables ware either dichotomous or polychotomous (more than two categories). 
Because social science data typically derive from attituidanl questionnaires or interviews that are structured in a Likert-type format, they are representative
of an ordinal scale. Nonetheless, it has been common practice in SEM, if the number of response categories of a variable is greater thatn two, to treat these
variables as if they were on a continuous scale. This practice has stemmed largely from the need for extremely large sample sizes and analyses that take 
the ordinality of the variables into account.
Although there is some evidence that the more categories there are, the less severe the bias, J{\{}{\{}{\"{o}}{\}}{\}}reskog and S{\{}{\{}{\"{o}}{\}}{\}}rbom (1993a, 1993c) maintained that, regardless,
these ordinal variables are not continuous variables and therefore should not be treated as such. They argued taht because these variables and therefore should
not be treated as such. They argued that because these variables have no metric, their means, variances, and covariances are not meaningful. As a consequence, 
subsequent analyses using LISREL may result in biased estimates.
Thus, when data comprise variables that are ordinal or of mixed scale types (odinal and continuous), and are to be analyzed using LISREL,
such analyses should be based on the polychoric or polyserial correlation matrix, respectively, using weighted least squares (WLS) estimation procedures.
This recommendation applies also to the special case where the data are tetrachoric (both variables are dichotomous) or biserial (the ordinal variable is dichotomous).},

abstract = {This paper discusses an approach to auditory stimulus design that appropriates concepts and techniques commonly used in music composition. These ideas are used to create referential sound cues that orient a listener along a timeline. The functions these cues serve may include: emphasizing arrival at targeted goals; providing orientation information relative to beginning and end times; or creating a sense of imminent closure indicating a predictive end to an ongoing process. The stimulus used in the pilot study represents this team's first attempt at integrating musical ideas with stimulus design. In an effort to make this stimulus comparable with previously used experimental stimuli, extreme restrictions were placed on the design. Although the resulting stimulus is not to be confused with `music' in the proper sense of that term, it is interesting to note how an extremely restricted set of elements can be manipulated to create an aesthetically satisfactory experience that rivals responses to `real' music in untrained listeners. The application of musical techniques towards the construction of effective auditory stimuli that are, at the same time, rated aesthetically satisfactory by users, is a long-term object of study by this team.},

abstract = {There is cognitive, neurological, and computational support for the hypothesis that defocusing attention results in divergent or associative thought, conducive to insight and finding unusual connections, while focusing attention results in convergent or analytic thought, conducive to rule-based operations. Creativity appears to involve both. It is widely believed that it is possible to escape mental fixation by spontaneously and temporarily engaging in a more associative mode of thought. The resulting insight (if found) may be refined in a more analytic mode of thought. The questions addressed here are: (1) how does the architecture of memory support these two modes of thought, and (2) what is happening at the neural level when one shifts between them? Recent advances in neuroscience shed light on this. Activated cell assemblies are composed of multiple neural cliques, groups of neurons that respond differentially to general or context-specific aspects of a situation. I refer to neural cliques that would not be included in the assembly if one were in an analytic mode, but would be if one were in an associative mode, as neurds. It is posited that the shift to a more associative mode of thought is accomplished by recruiting neurds that respond to abstract or atypical microfeatures of the problem or task. Since memory is distributed and content-addressable, this fosters the forging of associations to potentially relevant items previously encoded in those neurons. Thus it is proposed that creative thought not by searching a space of predefined alternatives and blindly tweaking those that hold promise, but by evoking remotely associated items through the recruitment of neurds in a distributed, content-addressable memory. 2},

abstract = {BACKGROUND {\&} OBJECTIVE: Smartphone use is almost universally relied on among college students. Whether smartphone addiction among college students has a negative predictive effect on academic performance is hardly studied. Previous research found an apparent association between smartphone use and academic achievement partly explained by the nature of the task the student is engaged in when using a smartphone. This study aims to assess the relationship between smartphone addiction and students' academic performance controlling for important potential confounding variables.METHODS: A sample of 688 undergraduate students was randomly selected from Notre Dame University, Lebanon. Students were asked to fill out a questionnaire that included a) questions on variables related to socio-demographics, academics, smartphone use, and lifestyle behaviors; and b) a 26-item Smartphone Addiction Inventory (SPAI) Scale. Multiple logistic regression was performed to assess the independent association between smartphone addiction and cumulative grade point average (GPA).RESULTS: 49{\%} reported smartphone use for at least 5 hours during a weekday. Controlling for confounding effects in the model, the association between total SPAI score and GPA did not reach statistical significance, whereas alcohol drinking (OR= 2.10, p=0.026), age at first use of smartphone (OR=1.20, p=0.042), use of smartphone for study-related purposes (OR=0.31, p=0.000), class (OR=0.35 (senior vs. sophomore standing), p=0.024), and faculty (ORs of 0.38 and 0.35 (engineering and humanities, respectively, vs. business students)) were found to be independent predictors of reporting a GPA of {\textless} 3.CONCLUSION: Findings from our study can be used to better inform college administrators and faculty about most-at- risk groups of students who shall be targeted in any intervention designed to enhance low academic performance.},

We propose that an attentional explanation provides the best way to advance theoretical models and produce practical applications, as well as providing potential solutions to core issues such as how an objectively difficult task can be subjectively effortless. Recent research has begun to utilize brain-imaging techniques to investigate neurocognitive changes during flow, which enables attentional mechanisms to be understood in greater detail. Some tensions within flow research are discussed; including the dissociation between psychophysiological and experiential measures, and the equivocal neuroimaging findings supporting prominent accounts of hypofrontality. While flow has received only preliminary investigation from a neuroscientific perspective, findings already provide important insights into the crucial role played by higher-order attentional networks, and clear indications of reduced activity in brain regions linked to self-referential processing. The manner in which these processes may benefit sporting performance are discussed.},

The traits most closely associated with SWB were repressive-defensiveness, trust, emotional stability, locus of control-chance, desire for control, hardiness, positive affectivity, private collective self-esteem, and tension. When personality traits were grouped according to the Big Five factors, Neuroticism was the strongest predictor of life satisfaction, happiness, and negative affect. Positive affect was predicted equally well by Extraversion and Agreeableness. The relative importance of personality for predicting SWB, how personality might influence SWB, and limitations of the present review are discussed.},

The best example may be Wallach and Kogan's (1965) landmark study of 151 children. In that study, 10 measures of creativity didn't correlate with 10 measures of intelligence and academic achievement (average r = .09). The present research reanalyzed these data using latent variable analysis, which can (a) assess the relations between latent creativity and intelligence variables and (b) model method variance shared by the creativity tasks. Consistent with past research, the latent originality and fluency variables significantly predicted intelligence. The relations' magnitude (around r = .20) was consistent with past research, suggesting that Wallach and Kogan's data replicate other studies of creativity and intelligence.},

abstract = {The business environment faced by contemporary organizations is highly
uncertain and constantly changing. Thus, organizations have adopted and
implemented a continuous stream of innovations to achieve sustainable
growth and survival. Considering the demand for additional resources to
implement innovations, the present study explores organizational
conditions that may lead to innovation-targeted burnout and fatigue
among employees, which impede their active participation in a subsequent
innovation. To this end, we propose a theoretical framework that
elucidates the effects of previous innovations on the subsequent
implementation behavior of employees. We identify two dimensions of the
cognitive appraisal of previous innovations (i.e., intensity and
failure) that shape employees' beliefs regarding innovations, such as
innovation-targeted helplessness, which ultimately results in innovation
fatigue. Data collected from 84 managers and 397 employees of Chinese
and Korean organizations prove the significant role of employee
perceptions of previous innovations in shaping the innovation-targeted
helplessness and fatigue of employees, which ultimately affect employee
behavior toward a subsequent innovation. The present conceptual and
empirical analyses suggest that given continuous streams of innovation
implementation, managers should carefully consider employee's
perceptions of previous innovations (i.e., intensity and failure) for
successful implementation of a subsequent innovation. Copyright (c) 2017

abstract = {This paper presents the first attempt at stereoscopic neural style transfer, which responds to the emerging demand for 3D movies or AR/VR. We start with a careful examination of applying existing monocular style transfer methods to left and right views of stereoscopic images separately. This reveals that the original disparity consistency cannot be well preserved in the final stylization results, which causes 3D fatigue to the viewers. To address this issue, we incorporate a new disparity loss into the widely adopted style loss function by enforcing the bidirectional disparity constraint in non-occluded regions. For a practical real-time solution, we propose the first feed-forward network by jointly training a stylization sub-network and a disparity sub-network, and integrate them in a feature level middle domain. Our disparity sub-network is also the first end-to-end network for simultaneous bidirectional disparity and occlusion mask estimation. Finally, our network is effectively extended to stereoscopic videos, by considering both temporal coherence and disparity consistency. We will show that the proposed method clearly outperforms the baseline algorithms both quantitatively and qualitatively.},

Our studies examined how the interaction of individual- and cultural-level personality affects people's self-esteem and well-being. We propose a person-culture match hypothesis that predicts that when a person's personality matches the prevalent personalities of other people in a culture, culture functions as an important amplifier of the positive effect of personality on self-esteem and subjective well-being at the individual level. Across two studies, using data from more than 7,000 individuals from 28 societies, multilevel random-coefficient analyses showed that when a relation between a given personality trait and well-being or self-esteem exists at the individual level, the relation is stronger in cultures characterized by high levels of that personality dimension. Results were replicated across extraversion, promotion focus, and locomotive regulatory mode. Our research has practical implications for the well-being of both cultural natives and migrants.},

The purpose of this paper is to combine the concepts of existing research on prestige consumers (rather limited) and studies which examined entirely different aspects of consumer behavior, but coincidentally produce valuable information. By examining all the sources of prestige consumption in a broad and integrated way, we shall provide a new perspective that draws from, rather than substitutes for, previous research. The objectives of this literature review can be summarized as follows: Contribute to the emerging literature on prestige consumption in examining and defining the key perceived values which form the concept of prestige. Interpret and expand existing consumer behavior models in order to develop a specific prestige-seeking consumer behavior framework. Generate a framework to help marketers build and monitor the prestige of brands. Stimulate further research on prestige-seeking consumer behavior.},

abstract = {Machine learning is one of the most important and successful techniques in contemporary computer science. Although it can be applied to myriad problems of human interest, research in machine learning is often framed in an impersonal way, as merely algorithms being applied to model data. However, this viewpoint hides considerable human work of tuning the algorithms, gathering the data, deciding what should be modeled in the first place, and using the outcomes of machine learning in the real world. Examining machine learning from a human-centered perspective includes explicitly recognizing human work, as well as reframing machine learning workflows based on situated human working practices, and exploring the co-adaptation of humans and intelligent systems. A human-centered understanding of machine learning in human contexts can lead not only to more usable machine learning tools, but to new ways of understanding what machine learning is good for and how to make it more useful. This special issue brings together nine articles that present different ways to frame machine learning in a human context. They represent very different application areas (from medicine to audio) and methodologies (including machine learning methods, human-computer interaction methods, and hybrids), but they all explore the human contexts in which machine learning is used. This introduction summarizes the articles in this issue and draws out some common themes.},

Unfortunately, the limited construct validity work conducted on commonly used GSE measures has highlighted such potential problems as low content validity and multidimension- ality. The authors developed a new GSE (NGSE) scale and compared its psycho- metric properties and validity to that of the Sherer et al. General Self-Efficacy Scale (SGSE). Studies in two countries found that theNGSEscale has higher con- struct validity than the SGSE scale. Although shorter than the SGSE scale, the NGSE scale demonstrated high reliability, predicted specific self-efficacy (SSE) for a variety of tasks in various contexts, and moderated the influence of previous performance on subsequent SSE formation.

abstract = {{\textcopyright}2015 Montag et al.Background: Mounting evidence shows that smartphone usage heavily disrupts our work life and social activities. Moreover, it is possible that overuse could resemble addictive tendencies. A key contributing factor to smartphone overuse seems to be usage of the messaging application WhatsApp. Although WhatsApp is one of the most commonly used communication applications on smartphones, research in this area is scarce. Given the huge societal debate on the impact of smartphone usage on our daily lives, the present study undertook a large-scale investigation in order to provide numbers on smartphone usage generally - and use of WhatsApp in particular, with the aim of providing a basis for a scientific debate. Methods: In a large sample of N = 2,418 users, we recorded WhatsApp behaviour over a 4 week period. Results: Our data show that use of WhatsApp accounted for 19.83{\%} (= 32.11 min) of all smartphone behaviour (compare: Facebook only 9.38{\%} = 15.19 min). The mean of general daily smartphone usage was 161.95 min. Females used WhatsApp for significantly longer periods of time than males and younger age was associated with longer duration of WhatsApp use. While the personality trait Extraversion was positively associated with daily WhatsApp use, Conscientiousness showed an inverse correlation with the length of daily WhatsApp use. Conclusions: The numbers on smartphone usage in the present study show that the smartphone dominates our daily life. In particular WhatsApp is a driving force, here. Given the length of daily smartphone and WhatsApp usage, more studies need to be conducted to better understand smartphone usage.},

Momentary accessibility has been cited as a major contributor to these judgments, yet the only previous investigation on the topic used judgments that were delayed a day after study, which have not been used in any other studies in the field and may be necessary for demonstrating accessibility-based effects. As expected, Experiment 1 demonstrated that the time between study and judgments moderates accessibility effects, with the relationship between judgments and access measures being substantially greater for delayed than for immediate judgments. Experiment 2 ruled out a plausible artifactual interpretation for accessibility effects on delayed judgments. In the discussion, we explore why study-judgment lags moderate accessibility effects.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 The Author(s).It is not too late, but about time to realize how damaging IT overuse can be. The present paper discusses why it is of tremendous importance to study the effect of the Internet, smartphone, and other new digital technologies on individuals' productivity and well-being. Besides its recognized addictive nature, it also becomes clear that such technology inevitably alters our natural social lives, which has, in our opinion, the potential to harm entire societies. In developed countries, we are more or less all using digital devices for communication purposes; we surf the Internet and we download apps on a daily basis. We present two lines of argument as to why the study of technological (over) use and its consequences is of tremendous importance. First, we outline under which circumstances use of smartphones and Internet can make us unproductive. Second, we anchor the (over)use of technologies in an affective neuroscience framework. Both these approaches to describing and understanding the consequences of digital technology use clearly show that many humans are already “overusing” technology. Therefore, we also provide some initial ideas on how to cut down technology use in order to live more satisfying and happier lives. Let us look into each other's eyes and begin to spend more quality time with our loved ones outside in nature instead of staring at digital devices.},

These debates are dynamic, characterized by many voices contesting numerous storylines. The discoursal features, including language choices and communication strategies, of the GM debate are in some ways taken for granted and in others actively manipulated by participants. Although there are many voices, some have more influence than others. This study makes use of 50 hours of in-depth interviews with GM scientists, nonexperts, and other stakeholders in the GM debate to examine this phenomenon. We uncover rhetorical devices used by scientists to characterize and ultimately undermine participation by non-experts in areas including rationality, knowledge, understanding and objectivity. Scientists engage with ‘the public' from their own linguistic and social domain, without reflexive confirmation of their own status as part of the public and the citizenry. This raises a number of interesting ironies and contradictions, which are explored in the article. As such, it provides valuable insights into an increasingly important type of discourse.},

abstract = {Building on Herbert Simon's critique of rational choice theory, Schwartz et al. (2002) proposed that when making choices, some individuals — maximizers — search extensively through many alternatives with the goal of making the best choice, whereas others — satisficers — search only until they identify an option that meets their standards, which they then choose. They developed the Maximization Scale (MS) to measure individual differences in maximization, and a substantial amount of research has now examined maximization using the MS, painting a picture of maximizers that is generally negative. Recently, however, several researchers have criticized the MS, and almost a dozen new measures of maximization have now been published, resulting in a befuddling and contradictory literature. We seek to clarify the confusing literature on the measurement of maximization to help make sense of the existing findings and to facilitate future research. We begin by briefly summarizing the understanding of maximizers that has emerged through research using Schwartz et al.'s MS. We then review the literature on the measurement of maximization, attempting to identify the similarities and differences among the 11 published measures of maximization. Next, we propose a two-component model of maximization, outlining our view of how maximization should be conceptualized and measured. Our model posits that maximization is best understood as the pursuit of the maximization goal of choosing the best option through the maximization strategy of alternative search; other constructs such as decision difficulty and regret are best considered outcomes or causes — rather than components — of maximization. We discuss the implications of our review and model for research on maximization, highlighting what we see as pressing unanswered questions and important directions for future investigations.},

abstract = {Results of several studies have suggested that smartphone addiction has negative effects on mental health and well-being. To contribute to knowledge on this topic, our study had two aims. One was to investigate the relationship between risk of smartphone addiction and satisfaction with life mediated by stress and academic performance. The other aim was to explore whether satisfaction with life mediated by stress and academic performance facilitates smartphone addiction. To identify test subjects, systematic random sampling was implemented. A total of 300 university students completed an online survey questionnaire that was posted to the student information system. The survey questionnaire collected demographic information and responses to scales including the Smartphone Addiction Scale - Short Version, the Perceived Stress Scale, and the Satisfaction with Life Scale. Data analyses included Pearson correlations between the main variables and multivariate analysis of variances. The results showed that smartphone addiction risk was positively related to perceived stress, but the latter was negatively related to satisfaction with life. Additionally, a smartphone addiction risk was negatively related to academic performance, but the latter was positively related to satisfaction with life.},

abstract = {Use of EEG signals in measuring cognitive load is a widely practiced area and falls under Brain-Computer-Interfacing (BCI) technology. However this technology uses medical grade EEG devices that are expensive as well as not user-friendly for regular use. Recent launch of low cost wireless EEG headsets from different companies opens up the possibility for commercialization of BCI and thus drew attention of the research community all over the world. While there are numerous studies on BCI with the use of medical grade devices there are limited numbers of papers reported on those using low cost devices. Moreover, reports on evaluating relative performance of these commercially available EEG devices based on a specific BCI experiment are minuscule. This paper attempts to fill this gap and presents a methodology to compare with various aspects between two widely used low cost wireless EEG devices namely Emotiv and Neurosky for application in cognitive load detection.},

We conclude that the major challenges presented by DesignX problems stem not from trying to understand or address the issues, but rather arise during implementation, when political, economic, cultural, organizational, and structural problems overwhelm all else. We suggest that designers cannot stop at the design stage: they must play an active role in implementation, and develop solutions through small, incremental steps—minimizing budgets and the resources required for each step— to reduce political, social, and cultural disruptions. This approach requires tolerance for existing constraints and trade-offs, and a modularity that allows for measures that do not compromise the whole. These designs satisfice rather than optimize and are related to the technique of making progress by “muddling through,” a form of incrementalism championed by Lindblom.},

This approach uses various kinds of educational technology to create mental perceptual simulations of topics being learned in addition to the usual symbolic mental representations. The goal is to have students have a feel (the perceptual simulation) for the topics in addition to knowing (the symbolic representation) about them. Educational technologies covered include interactive graphic computer simulations using movement and animation, graphic simulations that involve force feedback in addition to interaction, video game playing and creation, and robot creation and programming. Research results have indicated that these embodied ways of using educational technologies increases student learning and understanding as shown by memory and problem solving tests. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.},

It explores how these processes might be simulated in a student-learning environment and highlights the role of emotional exposure, situated learning action-orientation and discontinuity. An argument is made for experiential, work-based learning when seeking to simulate contexts similar to those in which entrepreneurs learn. A conceptual framework is introduced that highlights a course design based on the factors identified. In the analysis, formal course assessments are reviewed and narrative coding based on student reflections is evaluated. The article illustrates that it is possible to simulate aspects of entrepreneurial learning such as emotional exposure and situated learning but not others. It also demonstrates a range of learning benefits linked to experiential learning. In conclusion, the article explains why entrepreneurship education can play an important role in encouraging management learning. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR},

abstract = {International Journal of Design, IJDesign, IJD, SCI, SSCI, A{\&}HCI, The design research community acknowledges that usability and user experience are largely influenced by user characteristics, goals and contexts of use. For industrially manufactured products, these use situations are often dynamic and diverse. However, little guidance can be found in literature on the incorporation of dynamic and diverse use situations (DDUS) into the design process. This paper explores this issue by means of an analysis of user centred design literature and an empirical study of design for DDUS in design practice. We retrospectively studied three projects in which a product with DDUS was designed. Based on this study, we identified different effective strategies executed by design practitioners to analyse DDUS. We also observed difficulties in designing for DDUS. These difficulties include the identification of relevant aspects within this broad spectrum of use situations and sharing knowledge of product use between team members. We conclude that there is a need for guidance in the creation of flexible frames of reference of product use that evolve with solutions in the design process, particularly for design projects that cannot rely on the reuse of such a frame of reference from similar previous projects.},

abstract = {Social media measurement relies heavily on self-report survey research. Hence, known biases in how individuals answer survey questions can introduce systematic errors into the social media literature. In particular, many common social media measures are prone to acquiescence response bias, an error that occurs due to individuals' tendency to agree with agree-disagree questions. The current study tests a series of techniques to both detect and overcome acquiescence bias in the context of Facebook measurement. Controlling for individuals' tendency to agree with agree-disagree questions, we find evidence that acquiescence has inflated the reliabilities and factor loadings of many Facebook use scales, and has altered correlations both among Facebook use measures and between those measures and related covariates. Further, when the individual-level tendency to agree with questions is controlled, Facebook measures demonstrate greater criterion validity in their relations to items that do not use agree-disagree scales. Having identified the presence of acquiescent responding, we test three methods for mitigating this response bias: the use of balanced scales, item-specific questions, and statistical correctives. All three methods appear to reduce the bias introduced by acquiescence. Thus, the results provide comparative evidence on strategies to alleviate the consistent impact of an important method bias in social media measurement and thereby contribute to improving the validity of social media research at large.},

In contrast to existing approaches that are restricted to manipulations of facial expressions only, we are the first to transfer the full 3D head position, head rotation, face expression, eye gaze, and eye blinking from a source actor to a portrait video of a target actor. The core of our approach is a generative neural network with a novel space-time architecture. The network takes as input synthetic renderings of a parametric face model, based on which it predicts photo-realistic video frames for a given target actor. The realism in this rendering-to-video transfer is achieved by careful adversarial training, and as a result, we can create modified target videos that mimic the behavior of the synthetically-created input. In order to enable source-to-target video re-animation, we render a synthetic target video with the reconstructed head animation parameters from a source video, and feed it into the trained network -- thus taking full control of the target. With the ability to freely recombine source and target parameters, we are able to demonstrate a large variety of video rewrite applications without explicitly modeling hair, body or background. For instance, we can reenact the full head using interactive user-controlled editing, and realize high-fidelity visual dubbing. To demonstrate the high quality of our output, we conduct an extensive series of experiments and evaluations, where for instance a user study shows that our video edits are hard to detect.},

abstract = {The System Usability Scale (SUS), developed by Brooke (Usability evaluation in industry, Taylor {\&} Francis, London, pp 189-194, 1996), had a great success among usability practitioners since it is a quick and easy to use measure for collecting users' usability evaluation of a system. Recently, Lewis and Sauro (Proceedings of the human computer interaction international conference (HCII 2009), San Diego CA, USA, 2009) have proposed a two-factor structure-Usability (8 items) and Learnability (2 items)-suggesting that practitioners might take advantage of these new factors to extract additional information from SUS data. In order to verify the dimensionality in the SUS' two-component structure, we estimated the parameters and tested with a structural equation model the SUS structure on a sample of 196 university users. Our data indicated that both the unidimensional model and the two-factor model with uncorrelated factors proposed by Lewis and Sauro (Proceedings of the human computer interaction international conference (HCII 2009), San Diego CA, USA, 2009) had a not satisfactory fit to the data. We thus released the hypothesis that Usability and Learnability are independent components of SUS ratings and tested a less restrictive model with correlated factors. This model not only yielded a good fit to the data, but it was also significantly more appropriate to represent the structure of SUS ratings.},

abstract = {Mindfulness and flow are both beneficial states of mind, but are they difficult to experience simultaneously? After all, flow involves losing self-awareness within an activity, and mindfulness involves maintaining self-awareness throughout or even despite an activity. In three studies, we examine this potential antagonism, finding negative associations between mindfulness and flow as assessed in a variety of ways and contexts. These associations emerged within Global trait data and diary data concerning daily goal behavior (Study 1), experience-sampling data concerning behavior at the time of signaling (Study 2), and experimental data concerning the experience of playing the flow-conducive computer game, Tetris, after undergoing a mindfulness induction (Study 3). However, these associations only apply to the “absorption” aspect of flow, not the “sense of control” aspect.},

abstract = {Deep learning has penetrated all aspects of our lives and brought us great convenience. However, the process of building a high-quality deep learning system for a specific task is not only time-consuming but also requires lots of resources and relies on human expertise, which hinders the development of deep learning in both industry and academia. To alleviate this problem, a growing number of research projects focus on automated machine learning (AutoML). In this paper, we provide a comprehensive and up-to-date study on the state-of-the-art AutoML. First, we introduce the AutoML techniques in details according to the machine learning pipeline. Then we summarize existing Neural Architecture Search (NAS) research, which is one of the most popular topics in AutoML. We also compare the models generated by NAS algorithms with those human-designed models. Finally, we present several open problems for future research.},

abstract = {UPDATED – 10 February 2016. To this date the majority of the existing instruments to measure trustworthiness in an online context are based on Likert scaling [1,3,11]. These however are somewhat restricted in applicability. Statements formed in Likert scaling are typically addressing one specific website. Therefore, adjusting these statements for other websites can be accompanied with a loss of validity. To meet these limitations, we propose to use semantic differential. Research has shown that using semantic differential is appropriate to measure multidimensional constructs [8,12] such as trust. Our novel approach in measuring trustworthiness exceeds Likert based scaling in its effortless application in different online context and its better translatability. After one pre-study and two online-studies with a total of 554 participants we achieved to develop a questionnaire with nine items which is comparable to other existing questionnaires in terms of reliability and internal consistency. But it overcomes the limitation of Likert scale based questionnaire.},

Benchmarking is a natural development from the implementation of total quality management. It provides business organizations with the opportunity of taking an outward look at competitiveness by measuring true performance. This paper discusses various aspects of benchmarking such as its meaning, the diferent types of benchmarking, its implementation approaches and reported criteria facilitating its successful implementaiton. Since one of the di@culties of practising benchmarking is the obtainment of information, the paper discusses the merits of customer feedback in assessing current performance. As an example to highlight the importance of customer feedback, some data on customer-supplier interactions in the context of advanced manufacturing technology (AM T) have been used. The data refer on the one hand to suppliers' own assessment of the levels of support, back-up and training they provide for their customers, and customers' assessment on the levels of support, back-up and training received from their suppliers.},

abstract = {Using detailed traces from 255 users, we conduct a comprehensive study of smartphone use. We characterize intentional user activities -- interactions with the device and the applications used -- and the impact of those activities on network and energy usage. We find immense diversity among users. Along all aspects that we study, users differ by one or more orders of magnitude. For instance, the average number of interactions per day varies from 10 to 200, and the average amount of data received per day varies from 1 to 1000 MB. This level of diversity suggests that mechanisms to improve user experience or energy consumption will be more effective if they learn and adapt to user behavior. We find that qualitative similarities exist among users that facilitate the task of learning user behavior. For instance, the relative application popularity for can be modeled using an exponential distribution, with different distribution parameters for different users. We demonstrate the value of adapting to user behavior in the context of a mechanism to predict future energy drain. The 90th percentile error with adaptation is less than half compared to predictions based on average behavior across users.},

Objectives: Our aim was to derive a short version of the Mobile Phone Problem Use Scale (MPPUS) using data from 412 adolescents of the Swiss HERMES (Health Effects Related to Mobile phonE use in adolescentS) cohort. Methods: A German version of the original MPPUS consisting of 27 items was shortened by principal component analysis (PCA) using baseline data collected in 2012. For confirmation, the PCA was carried out again with follow-up data 1 year later. Results: PCA revealed four factors related to symptoms of addiction (Loss of Control, Withdrawal, Negative Life Consequences and Craving) and a fifth factor reflecting the social component of mobile phone use (Peer Dependence). The shortened scale (MPPUS-10) highly reflects the original MPPUS (Kendalls' Tau: 0.80 with 90{\%} concordant pairs). Internal consistency of MPPUS-10 was good with Cronbach's alpha: 0.85. The results were confirmed using the follow-up data. Conclusions: The MPPUS-10 is a suitable instrument for research in adolescents. It will help to further clarify the definition of problematic mobile phone use in adolescents and explore similarities and differences to other technological addictions.},

Monitoring social media platforms has recently fascinated medical natural language processing researchers to detect various medical abnormalities such as adverse drug reaction. In this paper, we present a benchmark setup for analyzing the sentiment with respect to users' medical condition considering the information, available in social media in particular. To this end, we have crawled the medical forum website 'patient.info' with opinions about medical condition self narrated by the users. We constrained ourselves to some of the popular domains such as depression, anxiety, asthma, and allergy. The focus is given on the identification of multiple forms of medical sentiments which can be inferred from users' medical condition, treatment, and medication. Thereafter, a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based medical sentiment analysis system is developed for the purpose of evaluation. The resources are made available to the community through LRE map for further research.},

These factors are judged as making people who they really are, deep down. In this paper, we introduce the concept of the true self and identify features that distinguish people's understanding of the true self from their understanding of the self more generally. In particular, we consider recent findings that the true self is perceived as positive and moral and that this tendency is actor-observer invariant and cross-culturally stable. We then explore possible explanations for these findings and discuss their implications for a variety of issues in psychology.},

It was moderated by whether study participants knew in advance (prospective paradigm) or only later (retrospective paradigm) that they would be required to judge duration. Although prospective judgments showed no overall sex effect, some levels of moderator variables showed a small but statistically significant effect. Retrospective judgments showed a larger subjective-to-objective duration ratio for females than for males, and several variables moderated this effect. Females' judgments also showed more intersubject variability than did males' judgments. Relative to males, females sustain attention to time more in the prospective paradigm and have better episodic memory in the retrospective paradigm.},

abstract = {Modern deep artificial neural networks have achieved impressive results through models with orders of magnitude more parameters than training examples which control overfitting with the help of regularization. Regularization can be implicit, as is the case of stochastic gradient descent and parameter sharing in convolutional layers, or explicit. Explicit regularization techniques, most common forms are weight decay and dropout, have proven successful in terms of improved generalization, but they blindly reduce the effective capacity of the model, introduce sensitive hyper-parameters and require deeper and wider architectures to compensate for the reduced capacity. In contrast, data augmentation techniques exploit domain knowledge to increase the number of training examples and improve generalization without reducing the effective capacity and without introducing model-dependent parameters, since it is applied on the training data. In this paper we systematically contrast data augmentation and explicit regularization on three popular architectures and three data sets. Our results demonstrate that data augmentation alone can achieve the same performance or higher as regularized models and exhibits much higher adaptability to changes in the architecture and the amount of training data.},

abstract = {This paper analyzes the relation between usability and aesthetics. In a laboratory study, 80 participants used one of four different versions of the same online shop, differing in interface-aesthetics (low vs. high) and interface-usability (low vs. high). Participants had to find specific items and rate the shop before and after usage on perceived aesthetics and perceived usability, which were assessed using four validated instruments. Results show that aesthetics does not affect perceived usability. In contrast, usability has an effect on post-use perceived aesthetics. Our findings show that the "what is beautiful is usable" notion, which assumes that aesthetics enhances the perception of usability can be reversed under certain conditions (here: strong usability manipulation combined with a medium to large aesthetics manipulation). Furthermore, our results indicate that the user's affective experience with the usability of the shop might serve as a mediator variable within the aesthetics-usability relation: The frustration of poor usability lowers ratings on perceived aesthetics. The significance of the results is discussed in context of the existing research on the relation between aesthetics and usability. {\textcopyright}2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Johnson and Hall (1988), for example, proposed that social support at work can act as a buffer against the adverse effects of low autonomy and high workload on psychological well-being.

abstract = {Empathy--the ability to share the feelings of others--is fundamental to our emotional and social lives. Previous human imaging studies focusing on empathy for others' pain have consistently shown activations in regions also involved in the direct pain experience, particularly anterior insula and anterior and midcingulate cortex. These findings suggest that empathy is, in part, based on shared representations for firsthand and vicarious experiences of affective states. Empathic responses are not static but can be modulated by person characteristics, such as degree of alexithymia. It has also been shown that contextual appraisal, including perceived fairness or group membership of others, may modulate empathic neuronal activations. Empathy often involves coactivations in further networks associated with social cognition, depending on the specific situation and information available in the environment. Empathy-related insular and cingulate activity may reflect domain-general computations representing and predicting feeling states in self and others, likely guiding adaptive homeostatic responses and goal-directed behavior in dynamic social contexts.},

The questionnaire consisted of fifteen items designed to rate customer attitudes toward three local malls. One additional issue of interest was to test if the reaction time to each of these scales was significantly different. As expected, the reaction time for the random scale displayed more variability around the mean. The type of scale used had a definite and statistically significant effect on the responses. The L-R scale biased the responses towards the favorable adjective, the R-L scale generated a bias in the opposite direction, and the mixed scale successfully eliminated any such bias.

This observation is one benchmark against wbicb tbe explanatory power of process models of bindsight bias can be measured. Therefore, we used it to put the recently proposed RAff model (Hoffrage, Hertwig, {\&} Gigerenzer, 2000) to another test. Our findings were consistent witb the "expertise effect." Specifically, we observed-using computer simulations of the RAff model-that the more comprehensive people's knowledge is in foresigbt, the smaller is their hindsight bias. In addition, we made two counterintuitive observations: First, the relation between foresight knowledge and hindsight bias appears to be independent of how knowledge is processed. Second, even if foresight knowledge is false, it can reduce hindsight bias. We conclude with a discussion of the functional value of hindsight bias.},

Finally, using a paradigm (Koriat {\&} Bjork, 2005) in which similar JOLs are given to forward and backward associative pairs, despite much worse performance on the backward pairs, study choice again followed the mistaken JOLs.

The general pattern in the data suggests that subjects use different sources of information to form these judgments.

What is design thinking really and—even more important—what could be its value in applying it in innovation practices? This paper presents four studies that together capture the value of design thinking in different early-stage innovation practices. Study 1 comprised a literature review on design thinking to form the basis of an agreed domain of discourse for design thinking in innovation. In Study 2, this shared domain of discourse was validated. This shared domain of discourse provided the input for Study 3, which investigated how innovators apply design thinking in early-stage innovation practices. It shows that the application of design thinking is dependent on the innovator's aim for the project, his or her vision on innovation, and the main challenge s/he is facing. This combination of characteristics is termed an image of design thinking. The images frame the application design activities in the context of the specific innovation project. Study 4 successfully validated the four images and shows that the combination of the images and the agreed domain of discourse can serve as a common language and a tool that allow capturing the value of design thinking in early-stage innovation.},

Unidimensionality was examined using a set of criteria developed for the 2-facet measurement model. Many misspecified parcel models produced admissible factor loadings despite poor overall fit and unacceptable residual covariances. The factor loadings alone may not be sufficient for evaluating latent factor representation. The findings suggest that parcels' unidimensionality should be analyzed before the measurement model to which they belong is entered into a comprehensive structural model.

abstract = {This study tested for the generality and personality correlates of acquiescent responding. Sixty-five undergraduate respondents answered the Jackson Personality Inventory (JPI) and Paulhus' (1991) Balanced Inventory of Desirable Responding. The 15 scales of the JPI each yielded independent acquiescence scores and trait scores. The 15 acquiescent scores were positively intercorrelated and showed one general factor in a factor analysis. Factor scores on this acquiescence factor were related to cognitive simplicity, rigid mental organization, and intolerance of alternatives, but not to socially desirable responding or other social concerns. These results imply that acquiescence is more of a cognitive style than a social response. {\textcopyright} 1997 Academic Press.},

He has been a pioneer in cognitive science and is one of the founders of the field of cognitive neuroscience. The experimental paradigms he has developed have provided a major foundation for the imaging of the human brain. It is our great honor and pleasure to work with him as he continues his pioneering efforts, now focusing on attentional development and its relation to education. Our development of marker tasks based on patterns of adult brain activation has allowed us to study infant and child development in neuroscientifically informed, yet nonintrusive ways. Together with Posner, we have been studying temperament in infants and young children in relation to underlying neural networks for self-control. Our effort began with the study of temperament and proceeded to making links between temperamental dimensions and neural circuitry using marker tasks derived from adult imaging studies. The levels of analysis available for this exploration now range from molecular genetics to the socialization of behavior. We hope that by furthering methodological links between different levels of analysis, a basis will be provided for examining the many exciting questions at their interface. This chapter examines parallel developments of executive attention and self- regulation, as well as the genetic and experience-related factors that influence the functioning of this system.},

Both cue familiarity and accessibility are assumed to contribute asynchronously to FOK, but whereas the effects of familiarity occur early, those of accessibility occur later and only when cue familiarity is sufficiently high to drive the interrogation of memory for potential answers. General information questions were used to orthogonally manipulate cue familiarity and accessibility. As expected, both familiarity and accessibility enhanced FOK judgments, but the effects of accessibility were found mostly when familiarity was high. This interactive pattern was replicated when FOK judgments were delayed but not when they were immediate. The results support the proposed cascaded model of FOK but also imply a differentiation between 2 variants of the accessibility heuristic.},

abstract = {Over the last decade many educational programs have integrated methodologies of design thinking across a variety of curriculums. This has cast a welcome light on creative processes and facilitated innovative solutions. Faculty and students in the sciences, humanities, business and technology now have resources to explore new possibilities and solutions that match their technologic capabilities. However, this framework for creative problem solving falls short in teaching core design and aesthetic principles. The challenge for educators becomes how to build shared learning environments between design and external domains. As an assistant professor in the New Media Design program at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), I have applied core design curriculum in an interdisciplinary program across design, development and digital humanities to begin this shared design education. This paper explores how an undergraduate design curriculum can be leveraged across technology and liberal arts fields to provide actionable skills, design vocabulary and aesthetic appreciation to the design thinking and practice.

abstract = {The relationship between metacognition and mindreading was investigated by comparing the monitoring of one's own learning (Self) and another person's learning (Other). Previous studies indicated that in self-paced study judgments of learning (JOLs) for oneself are inversely related to the amount of study time (ST) invested in each item. This suggested reliance on the memorizing-effort heuristic that shorter ST is diagnostic of better recall. In this study although an inverse ST-JOL relationship was observed for Self, it was found for Other only when the Other condition followed the Self condition. The results were interpreted in terms of the proposal that the processes underlying experience-based metacognitive judgments are largely unconscious. However, participants can derive insight from observing themselves as they monitor their own learning, and transfer that insight to Other, thus exhibiting a shift from experience-based to theory-based judgments. Although different processes mediate metacognition and mindreading, metacognition can inform mindreading.},

abstract = {A meta-analytic review of empirical studies that have investigated incubation effects on problem solving is reported. Although some researchers have reported increased solution rates after an incubation period (i.e., a period of time in which a problem is set aside prior to further attempts to solve), others have failed to find effects. The analysis examined the contributions of moderators such as problem type, presence of solution-relevant or misleading cues, and lengths of preparation and incubation periods to incubation effect sizes. The authors identified a positive incubation effect, with divergent thinking tasks benefiting more than linguistic and visual insight tasks from incubation. Longer preparation periods gave a greater incubation effect, whereas filling an incubation period with high cognitive demand tasks gave a smaller incubation effect. Surprisingly, low cognitive demand tasks yielded a stronger incubation effect than did rest during an incubation period when solving linguistic insight problems. The existence of multiple types of incubation effect provides evidence for differential invocation of knowledge-based vs. strategic solution processes across different classes of problem, and it suggests that the conditions under which incubation can be used as a practical technique for enhancing problem solving must be designed with care.

Arguably, however, these disciplines have more to contribute, because they include theories and models that can be applied as design frames and principles. More specifically, goal-setting, visualization, thematization, and conceptual reconfiguration are general mechanisms through which theories translate into design contributions. Actualizing radical design solutions via these mechanisms is discussed: theories provide appropriate means of abstraction, which allows ?distance? from user data; departure from the existing design and user paradigms toward ?what has not yet been imagined? is thereby possible. These suggestions draw from and are exemplified by a ship bridge design case.},

abstract = {Background: Empathy is an individual's capacity to understand the behavior of others, to experience their feelings, and to express that understanding to them. Empathic ability is an asset professionally for individuals, such as teachers, physicians and social workers, who work with people. Being empathetic is also critical to our being able to live with others in general, and ultimately to leading happier lives. Subsequently it seems imperative to examine if and how it is possible to enhance people's empathic ability. Purpose: The purpose of this article is to use narrative review method to analyze studies of empathy training in human service and social science disciplines over the past thirty years to address the questions: "How have people been trained in empathy and what are the findings?" and "How was empathy training evaluated and how valid are these evaluation findings?" Setting: Not applicable. Intervention: Not applicable. Research Design: Not applicable. Data Collection and Analysis: Narrative review. Findings: Twenty-nine articles pertaining to empathy training evaluation research were identified based on an advanced computer search on the following databases: "Education Full Text," "ProQuest Education Journals," "Web of Knowledge" and "Educational Resources Information Center" (ERIC). Seven types of training methods were noted in these 29 evaluations with the most popular being didactic related (42{\%}). All but two studies (93{\%}) reported positive findings, mainly in regard to learning (86{\%}), or the cognitive component of empathy. These findings suggest that regardless of the training method, individuals can learn about the concept of empathy. Unfortunately, information pertaining to the effects of training on individuals' feeling for others, and their ability and propensity to take the perspective of others and to demonstrate it in the natural environments is lacking. Consequently, very little is known about the trainability of the affective and behavioral components of empathy. Also, some of the findings were moderated by gender, age, education level, and time of measurement. Regarding evaluation research designs, most of the studies used self-reporting to collect trainees' knowledge about empathy and most of the quantitative studies used a control group and pretesting to examine training impact. Construct validity of both empathy measurement and training is very problematic. A majority of the studies did not clearly define empathy, provide training as defined, and/or measure what is being trained; conceptualization of empathy across studies was not consistent either. In sum, data from the studies reviewed were neither complete nor valid enough to provide a clear and full understanding of the trainability of empathy. More research is apparently needed and hopefully lessons learned from our review will be considered in designing future studies. (Contains 9 figures and 1 table.)},

Here, we examine whether this finding may be explained by the decision-making styles of self-reported maximizers. Expanding on Schwartz et al. (2002), we find that self-reported maximizers are more likely to show problematic decision-making styles, as evidenced by self-reports of less behavioral coping, greater dependence on others when making decisions, more avoidance of decision making, and greater tendency to experience regret. Con- trary to predictions, self-reported maximizers were more likely to report spontaneous decision making. However, the relationship between self-reported maximizing and worse life outcomes is largely unaffected by controls for measures of other decision-making styles, decision-making competence, and demographic variables},

This research area tackles the important problem that complex machines and algorithms often cannot provide insights into their behavior and thought processes. XAI allows users and parts of the internal system to be more transparent, providing explanations of their decisions in some level of detail. These explanations are important to ensure algorithmic fairness, identify potential bias/problems in the training data, and to ensure that the algorithms perform as expected. However, explanations produced by these systems is neither standardized nor systematically assessed. In an effort to create best practices and identify open challenges, we describe foundational concepts of explainability and show how they can be used to classify existing literature. We discuss why current approaches to explanatory methods especially for deep neural networks are insufficient. Finally, based on our survey, we conclude with suggested future research directions for explanatory artificial intelligence.},

The large axillary scent Glands found in humans appear to be well adapted for the production of pheromones, but may actually be used for non-pheromonal odor communication, such as the sharing of information about the immune system. Putative menstrual synchronization within social groups of women and putative acceleration of the menstrual cycle caused by men's odors may suggest the existence of human pheromone systems, but evidence in both cases is still inconclusive},

Multiple methods were used to examine the effects of conflict on both individual- and group-level variables to provide a more refined model of intragroup conflict. Results show that whether conflict was beneficial depended on the type of conflict and the structure of the group in terms of task type, task interdependence, and group norms. Relationship and task conflicts were negatively associated with individuals' satisfaction, liking of other group members, and intent to remain in the group. In groups performing very routine tasks, disagreements about the task were detrimental to group functioning. In contrast, in groups performing nonroutine tasks, disagreements about the tasks did not have a detrimental effect, and in some cases, such disagreements were actually beneficial. Contrary to expectations, norms encouraging open discussion of conflict were not always advantageous. The results suggest that while such norms were associated with an increase in the number and intensity of relationship conflicts, they did not increase members' ability to deal with the conflicts constructively. The model developed here contributes to an integrated perspective on organizational conflict.},

Increasing group size inhibits the performance of face-to-face brainstorming yet facilitates the performance of electronic brainstorming. Process blocking and evaluation apprehension appear to provide the fullest explanation of this phenomenon. Suggestions are made for facilitators who use brainstorming and for future research.},

College students (n = 189) completed measures of the Big Five and measures of creative cognition (fluency and quality of divergent thinking), everyday creative behaviors, creative achievement, and self-rated creativity. Latent variable models found broad effects of openness to experience and few effects of the other four domains. At the higher-order level, plasticity predicted higher scores on nearly all of the facets of creativity, and stability had several significant effects. For some creativity measures, plasticity and stability had opposing effects. Tests of latent interactions found no significant effects: plasticity and stability predict creatively independently, not jointly. {\textcopyright}2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Aspect based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is a subarea of opinion mining which enables one to gain deeper insights into the features of items which interest the users by mining reviews. In this paper we attempt to perform ABSA on movie review data. Unlike other domains such as camera, laptops restaurants etc, a major chunk of movie reviews is devoted to describing the plot and contains no information about user interests. The presence of such narrative content may potentially mislead the review analysis. The contribution of this paper is two-fold: a two class classification scheme for plots and reviews without the need for labeled data is proposed. The overhead of constructing manually labeled data to build the classifier is avoided and the resulting classifier is shown to be effective using a small manually built test set. Secondly we propose a scheme to detect aspects and the corresponding opinions using a set of hand crafted rules and aspect clue words. Three schemes for selection of aspect clue words are explored - manual labeling (M), clustering(C) and review guided clustering (RC). The aspect and sentiment detection using all the three schemes is empirically evaluated against a manually constructed test set. The experiments establish the effectiveness of manual labeling over cluster based approaches but among the cluster based approaches, the ones utilizing the review guided clue words performed better.},

Creativity in Context incorporates extensive new material, going far beyond the original to provide a comprehensive picture of how the motivation for creative behavior, and creativity itself, can be influenced by the social environment.Teresa Amabile describes new findings from both her own research and from the work of many others in the field, detailing not only the ways in which creativity can be killed by social-psychological influences, but also the ways in which it can be maintained and stimulated. The research and the theory have moved beyond a narrow focus on the immediate social environment to a consideration of broad social influences in business organizations, classrooms, and society at large; beyond a documentation of social influences to a consideration of the cognitive mechanisms by which social factors might impact creativity; and beyond subject populations consisting of children and college students to an inclusion of professional artists, research scientists, and other working adults.Amabile describes a greatly expanded set of methodologies for assessing creativity, and introduces a set of methodologies for assessing the social environment for creativity in non-experimental studies. Throughout, the book maintains a clear focus on a comprehensive view of creativityhow the social context can influence motivation and how motivation, in conjunction with personal skills and thinking styles, can lead to the expression of creative behavior within that context. The result is a clarified theory of how creativity actually happens, with strong implications for supporting and increasing essential aspects of human performance.},

abstract = {This paper presents a discursive review of the dimensions pleasure, arousal and dominance that Mehrabian and Russell developed in 1974 to assess environmental perception, experience, and psychological responses. Since then numerous researchers applied these dimensions to assess the experience of the physical environment and its perceived qualities. Although the dimensions appeared to be useful, there is a long- lasting debate going on among environmental psychologists about the interpretation of pleasure, arousal and dominance and its underlying mechanisms. Due to the lack of clarity researchers use different adjectives to describe environmental experiences, which makes any comparison between research findings difficult. This paper shows that the three dimensions can be linked to the current ABC Model of Attitudes: pleasure, arousal and dominance can be respectively related to affective, cognitive and conative responses, i.e. Affect, Cognition and Behaviour (ABC). In addition, connecting the three dimensions to the triad feeling, thinking and acting, can also help to improve our understanding, interpretation and measurement of pleasure, arousal and dominance. Based on this review, it is proposed to re-introduce the three dimensions and to replace the nowadays often used two dimensional model with pleasure and arousal by a three dimensional model, including dominance as a third dimension, to represent the complete range of human responses.

By legitimizing niceness as an employment criterion, "feminization" of management (requiring both agentic and communal traits for managers) may unintentionally promote discrimination against competent women. Participants made hiring recommendations for a feminized or masculine managerial job. Agentic female job applicants were viewed as less socially skilled than agentic males, but this perception only resulted in hiring discrimination for the feminized, not the masculine, job. Communal applicants (regardless of sex) invariably received low hiring ratings. Thus, women must present themselves as agentic to be hireable, but may therefore be seen as interpersonally deficient. Ironically, the feminization of management may legitimize discrimination against competent, agentic women.},

The combination process was influenced by whether the participants had previously brainstormed alone or in groups and the phase of the combination period (early vs. late). In a second study participants were presented lists of rare or common ideas to combine and build on either as individuals or groups. Although groups generated fewer combinations than nominal groups, they generated more novel and feasible combinations when combining rare ideas.

The authors have developed a statistical technique to correct nominal individual differences for differences introduced by random measurement error. Although researchers have suggested that people differ in the ability to detect lies, psychometric analyses of 247 samples reveal that these ability differences are minute. In terms of the percentage of lies detected, measurement-corrected standard deviations in judge ability are less than 1{\%}. In accuracy, judges range no more widely than would be expected by chance, and the best judges are no more accurate than a stochastic mechanism would produce. When judging deception, people differ less in ability than in the inclination to regard others' statements as truthful. People also differ from one another as lie- and truth-tellers. They vary in the detectability of their lies. Moreover, some people are more credible than others whether lying or truth-telling. Results reveal that the outcome of a deception judgment depends more on the liar's credibility than any other individual difference.},

A wide range of different models have been successfully applied to coarse level image classification, but only a few of them could be applied to fashion images due to the nature of the data: such images could belong to the one high-level topic such as 't-shirt', 'skirt' or 'sport shoes', but at the lower level be fine-grained (e.g. 'high heels', 'medium heels'). Each apparel shop can have its own fine-grained hierarchy leading to difficulties to acquire a big dataset. This work shows necessity of pre-trained model usage to achieve a good predictive quality. In addition, the article contains a description and an experimental study of an approach to stack features from pre-trained model and features learned directly from an image pixel representation. This approach significantly outperforms baseline methods in fine-grained image classification [1, 2, 3] and a classification based only on a pre-trained model.},

abstract = {“Design thinking” has generated significant attention in the business press and has been heralded as a novel problem-solving methodology well suited to the often-cited challenges business organizations face in encouraging innovation and growth. Yet the specific mechanisms through which the use of design, approached as a thought process, might improve innovation outcomes have not received significant attention from business scholars. In particular, its utility has only rarely been linked to the academic literature on individual cognition and decision-making. This perspective piece advocates addressing this omission by examining “design thinking” as a practice potentially valuable for improving innovation outcomes by helping decision-makers reduce their individual level cognitive biases. In this essay, I first review the assumptions, principles, and key process tools associated with design thinking. I then establish its foundation in the decision-making literature, drawing on an extensive body of research on cognitive biases and their impact. The essay concludes by advancing a set of propositions and research implications, aiming to demonstrate one particular path that future research might take in assessing the utility of design thinking as a method for improving organizational outcomes related to innovation. In doing so, it seeks to address the challenge of conducting academic research on a practice that is obviously popular in management circles but appears resistant to rigorous empirical inquiry because of the multifaceted nature of its “basket” of tools and processes and the complexity of measuring the outcomes it produces.},

Twenty healthy volunteers viewed pictures of hand gestures with negative (insult) and positive (approval) emotional meaning as well as neutral control gestures (pointing) while dense sensor event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded. Emotion effects were reflected in distinct ERP modulations in early and later time windows. Insult gestures elicited increased P1, early posterior negativity (EPN) and late positive potential (LPP) components as compared to neutral control gestures. Processing of approval gestures was associated with an increased P1 wave and enlarged EPN amplitudes during an early time window, while the LPP amplitude was not significantly modulated. Accordingly, negative insult gestures appear more potent than positive approval gestures in inducing a heightened state of attention during processing stages implicated in stimulus recognition and focused attention.},

abstract = {Interpersonal influence in consumer behavior is moderated by the extent of con-sumer sensitivity to social comparison information concerning product purchase and usage behavior (cf. Calder and Burnkrant 1977). Two survey studies indicate that Lennox and Wolfe's (1984) attention-to-social-comparison-information (AT-SCI) scale has adequate convergent and discriminant validity and moderates the relative influence of normative consequences on behavioral intentions, as pre-dicted. A quasi-experiment and an experiment in which control subjects under no social pressure are compared with high and low ATSCI subjects under pressure reveal that high ATSCI subjects are more likely to comply with normative pressures. T he operation of interpersonal processes is depen-dent upon the individual's attending to and act-ing upon the beliefs, thoughts, and expectations of others. The premise underlying the present research is that the extent to which individuals are sensitive to social comparison cues relevant to their product choices and usage is a mediator of interpersonal in-fluence. That is, the influence that others have on in-dividual decisions is often due to the person's concern or caring about reactions to his/her behavior. In this article, we first present the results of two studies de-signed to evaluate both the validity of the measure used to identify individual variation in sensitivity and its ability to moderate the relative influence of inter-personal influence variables within Miniard and Co-hen's (1983) model of behavioral intention. Second, the results of two experiments that tested the effects of sensitivity to social comparison information and peer pressure on conformity rates are presented. An explication of the nature of social comparison infor-mation and the role that attention to such informa-tion plays in consumer behavior precedes the presen-tation of the studies.},

abstract = {Two experiments were conducted to explore young children's memory monitoring abilities on a judgment-of-learning (JOL) task. Recent research on adults' JOLs has shown that predictions about subsequent recall for items that have been recently studied have never been very accurate immediately after learning but have been very accurate when judgments were delayed. One of the major goals of the present studies was to investigate whether the delayed-JOL effect could be observed in children of different ages. A secondary goal of the study was to compare individual-item JOLs with aggregate JOLs based on all items of a given list. If young children possess basic monitoring skills, both their delayed JOLs and their aggregate judgments should be comparably realistic. Our two experiments confirmed this assumption for all age groups involved (kindergartners, second and fourth graders). That is, JOLs were much more accurate when given after a delay of about 2 min than immediately after study, and overconfidence was typically larger for item-by-item JOLs than for aggregate-item JOLs. In fact, the pattern of findings for the older school children was very similar to that found for adults. Overall, these findings support the position that developmental trends in children's procedural metamemory are not due to differences in basic monitoring skills but attributable to developmental changes concerning the interplay between monitoring and self-regulation activities.},

First, two pairs of experiments respectively scrutinized knowledge about (1) ordinary facts and (2) national capitals. The first experiment of each pair extracted normative data: The participants indicated whether they had probably once known the answer to a question (once-knew-it scale), supplied the answer if they knew it, and either judged the likelihood of their recognizing the answer or made other pertinent metacognitive judgments. In these norming experiments, recognition ratings were highly correlated with once-knew-it responses, and both measures were highly predictive of performance. Thisindicated that both measures reflect feeling of knowing judgments. In the second experiment of each pair, different participants were timed as they indicated whether they knew the answer to the same questions. Responselatencies for responding "don't know" were strongly positively correlated with the once-knew-it judgments made by the norming participants. This relationship was corroborated by Experiment 5, which compared the crucial measures within participants. These outcomes suggest that, in this context, feeling of knowing judgments are predictive of how long people will search memory for requested information.},

We used an incubation paradigm to assess whether performance on validated creativity problems (the Unusual Uses Task, or UUT) can be facilitated by engaging in either a demanding task or an undemanding task that maximizes mind wandering. Compared with engaging in a demanding task, rest, or no break, engaging in an undemanding task during an incubation period led to substantial improvements in performance on previously encountered problems. Critically, the context that improved performance after the incubation period was associated with higher levels of mind wandering but not with a greater number of explicitly directed thoughts about the UUT. These data suggest that engaging in simple external tasks that allow the mind to wander may facilitate creative problem solving.},

The samples were prepared by the tape-casting method, which had 180 dielectric layers with an average thickness of 1.4$\backslash$mu m. The thermodynamic calculation based on the polarization- temperature curves predicted a peak heat adsorption of 0.32J/g at 80{\^{}}$\backslash$circC under 176kV/cm electric field. The direct measurement via differential scanning calorimeter showed a much higher electrocaloric effect of 0.91J/g at 80{\^{}}$\backslash$circC under same electric field. The difference could result from the different trends of changes of electric polarization and lattice elastic energy under ultrahigh electric field.},

abstract = {Decades of research have shown that the correlation between job satisfaction and job performance is modest in magnitude,
yet lay people are thought to believe strongly that satisfied or happy employees are more productive at work.
It is possible that lay people base their beliefs on genuinely stronger relationships that occur at a different level of analysis than usually studied by researchers, and/or that exist between satisfaction-like and performance-like variables other than the constructs typically investigated by scholars. 

Study 2 provides data relevant to several of these possibilities.

The most compelling findings were at the within-person level of analysis. The average
within-person correlation between momentary task satisfaction and concurrent perceived task performance was 0.57.
Individuals feel more satisfied than usual when they believe they are performing better than usual for them. 
If lay persons mistakenly generalize from their own within-person experiences of satisfaction-performance covariation 
to the between-persons level, this relationship may be the basis for the strong lay belief that satisfied workers perform better.},

@article{Marzano1998,
abstract = {Instructional research is synthesized, using categories specific and functional enough to provide guidance for classroom practice. The opening chapter presents a theory for conducting a theory-based meta-analysis of the research on instruction, outlining a theory that involves four elements of human information processing: the self-system, the metacognitive system, the cognitive system, and knowledge. Chapter 2 describes the ways in which these four elements are represented in permanent memory. In chapter 3, the four elements and their subcomponents are described in detail. Chapter 4 describes specific design features of the meta-analysis, and chapters 5 through 8 present the results of the meta-analysis. Chapter 9 contains a general discussion of the findings in terms of classroom practice. In all, the meta-analysis used more than 4,000 effect sizes that involved an estimated 1,237,00 subjects. One observation that results from the meta-analysis is that the self-system appears to be the control center for human behavior, while the metacognitive system is the engine of learning. Three relatively straightforward implications are drawn. The teacher should: (1) identify knowledge and skills that are targets of instruction; (2) identify and use specific instructional techniques for specific instructional goals; and (3) use instructional techniques that apply to all types of instructional goals.

abstract = {We present a computational framework for automatically quantifying verbal and nonverbal behaviors in the context of job interviews. The proposed framework is trained by analyzing the videos of 138 interview sessions with 69 internship-seeking undergraduates at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Our automated analysis includes facial expressions (e.g., smiles, head gestures, facial tracking points), language (e.g., word counts, topic modeling), and prosodic information (e.g., pitch, intonation, and pauses) of the interviewees. The ground truth labels are derived by taking a weighted average over the ratings of nine independent judges. Our framework can automatically predict the ratings for interview traits such as excitement, friendliness, and engagement with correlation coefficients of 0.70 or higher, and can quantify the relative importance of prosody, language, and facial expressions. By analyzing the relative feature weights learned by the regression models, our framework recommends to speak more fluently, use fewer filler words, speak as 'we' (versus 'I'), use more unique words, and smile more. We also find that the students who were rated highly while answering the first interview question were also rated highly overall (i.e., first impression matters). Finally, our MIT Interview dataset is available to other researchers to further validate and expand our findings.},

In a study involving 84 participants taking a cartoon caption test and a nominal product brainstorming test, we found that improvisational comedians on average produced 20{\%} more product ideas and 25{\%} more creative product ideas than professional product designers. Individual quantity of product ideas was highly correlated (r 2=.82) with that individual's product creativity scores, and individual quantity of cartoon captions was highly correlated (r 2=.64) with that individual's caption humor scores. It was also found that the few individuals that were highly fluent in prolific creative product ideation were also highly fluent in prolific humorous cartoon caption production. The majority of these prolific generators had improvisational comedy training. Many of the games used in introductory improvisation comedy classes are designed to train people in making prolific non-obvious connections between seemingly unrelated things. A workshop was developed composed of these association-based games with the goal of helping designers be more prolific, and thus creative, idea generators. A group of 11 subjects who participated in this workshop increased their idea output on average by 37{\%} in a subsequent product brainstorming session.},

The experimental evaluation of the devices, performed with 10 subjects asked to perform concentration/relaxation and blinking recognition tasks, is given. The results of statistical analysis show that both devices exhibit high variability and non-normality of attention and meditation data, which makes each of them difficult to use as an input to control tasks. BCI illiteracy may be a significant problem, as well as setting up of the proper environment of the experiment. The results of blinking recognition show that using the Neurosky device means recognition accuracy is less than 50{\%}, while the Emotiv device has achieved a recognition accuracy of more than 75{\%}; for tasks that require concentration and relaxation of subjects, the Emotiv EPOC device has performed better (as measured by the recognition accuracy) by ∼9{\%}.

It is for psychology experiments and questionnaires because we cover the main statistical methods used by psychologists who do research on human subjects, but of course it this is also relevant to researchers in others fields that do similar kinds of research. R, like SPlus, is based on the S language invented at Bell Labs. Most of this should also work with SPlus. Because R is open-source (hence also free), it has benefitted from the work of many contributors and bug finders. R is a complete package. You can do with it whatever you can do with Systat, SPSS, Stata, or SAS, including graphics. Contributed packages are added or updated almost weekly; in some cases these are at the cutting edge of statistical practice. Some things are more difficult with R, especially if you are used to using menus. With R, it helps to have a list of commands in front of you. There are lists in the on-line help and in the index of An introduction to R by the R Core Development Team, and in the reference cards listed in http://finzi.psych.upenn.edu/. Some things turn out to be easier in R. Although there are no menus, the on-line help files are very easy to use, and quite complete. The elegance of the language helps too, particularly those tasks involving the manipulation of data.

@article{KeesDorst2006,
abstract = {Introduction The problem-solving literature that arose in the 1960s and 1970s in the promising and exciting field of artificial intelligence has had a profound impact on Design Methodology. The introduction of these theories in Design Methodology, at the start of the 1970s, helped to systemize the models and methods of design existing then, and link them to models of problem solving in other fields. There were high hopes that the very nature of design could be captured in a description that was based upon considering design the solution to " ill-structured problems. " Although there have been many developments since then, the original work on problem solving and the nature of ill-structured problems, written by Herbert Simon, still looms large over the field of design methodology. The rational problem-solving paradigm, based on the conceptual framework that Simon introduced, is still a dominant paradigm in the field. 1 Design models and methods have been developed within this paradigm; the conceptual framework of rational problem solving has become the normal " language " of thinking and talking about design. There also have been many critiques of Simon's problem-solving approach and its applicabil-ity to the field of design, and many of the original statements in the problem-solving theory that deal with design have since been qualified and refined. However, these critiques have not produced a fundamentally different alternative to the conceptual framework. In this piece, we will revisit the basic assumptions behind Simon's approach to design, notably the central concept of " ill-structured problem, " and introduce some ideas that could lead to an alternative conceptual framework for thinking about design prob-lems. First, we will revisit the original work by Simon at considerable length, and unearth the assumptions that underlie the conceptual framework that Simon uses to describe ill-structured problems. Then we will deal with some more recent developments within the problem-solving framework, and discuss some of the critiques on the rational problem-solving approach to design—again concentrat-ing on the central notion of ill-structured problems. We will use this critique to propose a fledgling framework of alternative concepts that could be used to augment our understanding of the nature of 1 C.H. Dorst, Describing Design: A Comparison of Paradigms (thesis TUDelft, 1997). 5 " design problems. " We will end with some further reflections and ideas for the development of an alternative framework for describ-ing design. The Core of Simon's Theory In describing the core of Simon's conceptual framework, we first will concentrate on his classic 1973 paper: " The Structure of Ill-structured Problems. " Unless otherwise stated, all quotes used in this section are taken from that paper. Of course, the conceptual framework that an author uses can be read from any paper, but this paper is especially suited because it is nicely explicit in its application to the field of design—although still broader in its orientation. The most important conclusions have been checked with other (later) papers by Simon. Within Simon's theory, the issue of the solution of design problems takes the stage as an example of a wider category of problems—what he terms " ill-structured problems. " In his paper, Simon sets out to explore the relation between ill-structured prob-lems and " well-structured problems. " He starts with the remark that many kinds of problems that often are treated as well-structured probably should be regarded as ill-structured. Even the limited problems (" limited " in the sense of taking place in an enclosed and well-defined world) that are used as standard examples in problem solving and AI literature, such as in playing chess, display elements of ill-structuredness on closer scrutiny: Even if we regard chess playing as a well-structured prob-lem in the small, by most criteria it must be regarded as an ill-structured problem in the large (over the course of the game). The stated goal of his paper is to show that there is no real boundary between well-structured problems and ill-structured problems, and therefore no reason to assume that the solution of ill-structured prob-lems would require new and hitherto unknown types of problem-solving processes. To start the comparison, Simon lists the following properties of well-structured problems: 1 There is a definite criterion for testing any proposed solu-tion, and a mechanical process for applying the criterion. 2 There is at least one problem space in which it can be represented as the initial problem state, the goal state, and all other states that may be reached, or considered, in the course of attempting a solution to the problem. 3 Attainable state changes (legal moves) can be represented in a problem space, as transitions from given states to the states directly attainable from them. But considerable moves, whether legal or not, also can be represented—that is, all transitions from one considerable state to another.},

abstract = {Machine learning systems are becoming increasingly ubiquitous. These systems's adoption has been expanding, accelerating the shift towards a more algorithmic society, meaning that algorithmically informed decisions have greater potential for significant social impact. However, most of these accurate decision support systems remain complex black boxes, meaning their internal logic and inner workings are hidden to the user and even experts cannot fully understand the rationale behind their predictions. Moreover, new regulations and highly regulated domains have made the audit and verifiability of decisions mandatory, increasing the demand for the ability to question, understand, and trust machine learning systems, for which interpretability is indispensable. The research community has recognized this interpretability problem and focused on developing both interpretable models and explanation methods over the past few years. However, the emergence of these methods shows there is no consensus on how to assess the explanation quality. Which are the most suitable metrics to assess the quality of an explanation? The aim of this article is to provide a review of the current state of the research field on machine learning interpretability while focusing on the societal impact and on the developed methods and metrics. Furthermore, a complete literature review is presented in order to identify future directions of work on this field.},

We found activations in left dorsolateral, left anterior, bilateral inferior, and medial prefrontal cortices that significantly increased as the FOK became greater, and the activations remained significant even when the potentially confounding factor of the response latency was removed. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the FOK region in the right inferior frontal gyrus and a subset of the FOK region in the left inferior frontal gyrus are not recruited for successful recall processes, suggesting their particular role in metamemory processing.},

abstract = {Empathy is a critical aspect of human emotion that influences the behavior of individuals as well as the functioning of society. Although empathy is fundamentally a subjective experience, no studies have yet examined the neural correlates of the self-reported experience of empathy. Furthermore, although behavioral research has linked empathy to prosocial behavior, no work has yet connected empathy-related neural activity to everyday, real-world helping behavior. Lastly, the widespread assumption that empathy is an automatic experience remains largely untested. It is also unknown whether differences in trait empathy reflect either variability in the automaticity of empathic responses or the capacity to feel empathy. In this study, 32 participants completed a diary study of helping behavior followed by an fMRI session, assessing empathic responses to sad images under three conditions: watching naturally, under cognitive load, and while empathizing. Across conditions, higher levels of self-reported experienced empathy were associated with greater activity in medial PFC (MPFC). Activity in MPFC was also correlated with daily helping behavior. Self-report of empathic experience and activity in empathy-related areas, notably MPFC, were higher in the empathize condition than in the load condition, suggesting that empathy is not a fully automatic experience. Additionally, high trait empathy participants displayed greater experienced empathy and stronger MPFC responses than low trait empathy individuals under cognitive load, suggesting that empathy is more automatic for individuals high in trait empathy. These results underline the critical role that MPFC plays in the instantiation of empathic experience and consequent behavior.},

Research reviewed in this article probes the control processes that reconfigure mental resources for a change of task by requiring subjects to switch frequently among a small set of simple tasks. Subjects' responses are substantially slower and, usually, more error-prone immediately after a task switch. This 'switch cost' is reduced, but not eliminated, by an opportunity for preparation. It seems to result from both transient and long-term carry-over of 'task-set' activation and inhibition as well as time consumed by task-set reconfiguration processes. Neuroimaging studies of task switching have revealed extra activation in numerous brain regions when subjects prepare to change tasks and when they perform a changed task, but we cannot yet separate 'controlling' from 'controlled' regions.},

abstract = {This paper explores the nature of adaptive learning around new technology in organizations. To understand this issue, we examine the process of problem solving involving new production equipment during early factory use. We find that adaptation is a situated process, in that different organizational settings (1) contain different kinds of clues about the underlying issues, (2) offer different resources for generating and analyzing information, and (3) evoke different assumptions on the part of problem solvers. Consequently, actors frequently must move in an alternating fashion between different organizational settings before they can identify the causal underpinnings of a problem and develop a suitable solution. These findings suggest that traditional, decontextualized theories of adaptive learning and of collaboration could be improved by taking into account that learning occurs through people interacting in context-or, more specifically, in multiple contexts. Learning is often enhanced not just by bringing people together, but by moving them around to confront different sorts of clues, gather different kinds of data, use different kinds of tools, and experience different pressures relevant to a given problem. We discuss both managerial and theoretical implications of these findings.},

abstract = {Based on the work of Lakoff and Johnson, this paper argues that part of our product experience is rooted in bodily interactions between people and their environments. Lakoff and Johnson convincingly demonstrated that repeated bodily interactions of a similar kind lead to the formation of image schemas guiding our understanding of verbal expressions. Here, it is proposed that the same underlying principles also govern our understanding of the expression of products. If correct, product expressions theoretically structured by the same underlying schema must be highly related. An experimental study involving chairs partly confirmed this prediction. The paper closes with a tentative discussion on how a chair's perceived expression could be related to the embodiment of schemas in its spatial and material features. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Dickey2005,
abstract = {(1) Department of Educational Psychology at Miami University, Miami, USA Abstract Computer and video games are a prevalent form of entertainment in which the purpose of the design is to engage players. Game designers incorporate a number of strategies and tactics for engaging players in “gameplay.” These strategies and tactics may provide instructional designers with new methods for engaging learners. This investigation presents a review of game design strategies and the implications of appropriating these strategies for instructional design. Specifically, this study presents an overview of the trajectory of player positioning or point of view, the role of narrative, and methods of interactive design. A comparison of engagement strategies in popular games and characteristics of engaged learning is also presented to examine how strategies of game design might be integrated into the existing framework of engaged learning.

annote = {Note5 support as climate or group process variable
Differentiation:
support as a climate variable (verbal support - influencing an individual's engagement in creative behavior. ) OR as a group interaction process variable (practical support - that transforms individual inputs into group outputs).
Verbal support should influence an individual's willingness to propose ideas to the group and to participate in the group process and appears to contribute primarily to the group's climate for innovation. 
Practical support, because it involves the group's actual commitment of resources and cooperation, seems more appropriately to be a group interaction process variable where group members dedicate resources to innovation activities.

General:
A supportive climate is described in various ways including mutual trust among team members (Scott {\{}{\&}{\}}amp; Bruce, 1994; Tierney, 1999), cooperation within the group (Scott {\{}{\&}{\}}amp; Bruce, 1994; West, 1990), shared commitment to goals and projects (Amabile, et al., 1996; Siegel {\{}{\&}{\}}amp; Kaemmerer, 1978), and interpersonal support (Tierney, 1999; West, 1990).},

abstract = {The interaction between human beings and computers will be more natural if computers are able to perceive and respond to human non-verbal communication such as emotions. Although several approaches have been proposed to recognize human emotions based on facial expressions or speech, relatively limited work has been done to fuse these two, and other, modalities to improve the accuracy and robustness of the emotion recognition system. This paper analyzes the strengths and the limitations of systems based only on facial expressions or acoustic information. It also discusses two approaches used to fuse these two modalities: decision level and feature level integration. Using a database recorded from an actress, four emotions were classified: sadness, anger, happiness, and neutral state. By the use of markers on her face, detailed facial motions were captured with motion capture, in conjunction with simultaneous speech recordings. The results reveal that the system based on facial expression gave better performance than the system based on just acoustic information for the emotions considered. Results also show the complementarily of the two modalities and that when these two modalities are fused, the performance and the robustness of the emotion recognition system improve measurably.},

abstract = {The present study investigates the role of process and social oriented smartphone usage, emotional intelligence, social stress, self-regulation, gender, and age in relation to habitual and addictive smartphone behavior. We conducted an online survey among 386 respondents. The results revealed that habitual smartphone use is an important contributor to addictive smartphone behavior. Process related smartphone use is a strong determinant for both developing habitual and addictive smartphone behavior. People who extensively use their smartphones for social purposes develop smartphone habits faster, which in turn might lead to addictive smartphone behavior. We did not find an influence of emotional intelligence on habitual or addictive smartphone behavior, while social stress positively influences addictive smartphone behavior, and a failure of self-regulation seems to cause a higher risk of addictive smartphone behavior. Finally, men experience less social stress than women, and use their smartphones less for social purposes. The result is that women have a higher chance in developing habitual or addictive smartphone behavior. Age negatively affects process and social usage, and social stress. There is a positive effect on self-regulation. Older people are therefore less likely to develop habitual or addictive smartphone behaviors.},

As approaches based on the analysis of utterances' linguistic properties are not sufficient to identify all fictional character types, we develop an integrative approach that complements linguistic analysis with interactive and communication characteristics, and show that it can improve the identification performance. The interactive characteristics of fictional characters are captured by the descriptive analysis of semantic graphs weighted by linguistic markers of expressivity and social role. For this approach, we introduce a new data set of action movie character types with their corresponding sequences of dialogs. The evaluation results demonstrate that the integrated approach outperforms baseline approaches on the presented data set. Comparative in-depth analysis of a single screenplay leads on to the discussion of possible limitations of this approach and to directions for future research.},

These tasks have become of great importance, especially for business and marketing professionals, since online posted products and services reviews impact markets and consumers shifts. This work is motivated by the fact that automating retrieval and detection of sentiments expressed for certain products and services embeds complex processes and pose research challenges, due to the textual phenomena and the language specific expression variations. This paper proposes a fast, flexible, generic methodology for sentiment detection out of textual snippets which express people's opinions in different languages. The proposed methodology adopts a machine learning approach with which textual documents are represented by vectors and are used for training a polarity classification model. Several documents' vector representation approaches have been studied, including lexicon-based, word embedding-based and hybrid vectorizations. The competence of these feature representations for the sentiment classification task is assessed through experiments on four datasets containing online user reviews in both Greek and English languages, in order to represent high and weak inflection language groups. The proposed methodology requires minimal computational resources, thus, it might have impact in real world scenarios where limited resources is the case.},

abstract = {Dating and romantic relationships not only play a huge role in our personal lives but also collectively influence and shape society. Today, many romantic partnerships originate from the Internet, signifying the importance of technology and the web in modern dating. In this paper, we present a text-based computational approach for estimating the relationship com-patibility of two users on social media. Unlike many pre-vious works that propose reciprocal recommender systems for online dating websites, we devise a distant supervision heuristic to obtain real world couples from social platforms such as Twitter. Our approach, the COUPLENET is an end-to-end deep learning based estimator that analyzes the social profiles of two users and subsequently performs a similarity match between the users. Intuitively, our approach performs both user profiling and match-making within a unified end-to-end framework. COUPLENET utilizes hierarchical recur-rent neural models for learning representations of user pro-files and subsequently coupled attention mechanisms to fuse information aggregated from two users. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first data-driven deep learning approach for our novel relationship recommendation prob-lem. We benchmark our COUPLENET against several ma-chine learning and deep learning baselines. Experimental re-sults show that our approach outperforms all approaches sig-nificantly in terms of precision. Qualitative analysis shows that our model is capable of also producing explainable re-sults to users.},

abstract = {Psychological theories have suggested that creativity involves a twofold process characterized by a generative component facilitating the production of novel ideas and an evaluative component enabling the assessment of their usefulness. The present study employed a novel fMRI paradigm designed to distinguish between these two components at the neural level. Participants designed book cover illustrations while alternating between the generation and evaluation of ideas. The use of an fMRI-compatible drawing tablet allowed for a more natural drawing and creative environment. Creative generation was associated with preferential recruitment of medial temporal lobe regions, while creative evaluation was associated with joint recruitment of executive and default network regions and activation of the rostrolateral prefrontal cortex, insula, and temporopolar cortex. Executive and default regions showed positive functional connectivity throughout task performance. These findings suggest that the medial temporal lobe may be central to the generation of novel ideas and creative evaluation may extend beyond deliberate analytical processes supported by executive brain regions to include more spontaneous affective and visceroceptive evaluative processes supported by default and limbic regions. Thus, creative thinking appears to recruit a unique configuration of neural processes not typically used together during traditional problem solving tasks. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {More than 80{\%} of the Dutch are online via their smartphones. While these devices have a lot positive features, they also can create problematic behaviors, such as a smartphone addiction. In this research, the process of developing smartphone habits and smartphone addiction are investigated. Furthermore, the effect of social usage, process usage, emotional intelligence, social stress, and self- regulation on smartphone addiction and habits are examined. Finally, the role of age and gender on all determinants is further explored. While prior research on online addiction is a well-developed research domain, studies focusing on this phenomenon in the smartphone context are relatively new. It is assumed that (smartphone) addiction can be developed through repeated actions (habits): when an action is rewarding, it will likely reoccur, this is also called operant conditioning. Process usage is typically a sort of usage that is pleasurable and rewarding; likewise, social usage of a smartphone is rewarding and can function as a substitute for other communication channels (e.g., face-to-face interaction). Therefore, personal factors are of importance. Emotional intelligence (EI) influences our well-being and, in addition, determines our capability to communicate. Other personal factors, such as social stress, influence the way we communicate. Specifically, people with high levels of social stress have more anxiety to meet people face-to-face and present themselves. Finally, self- regulation — i.e. how good people are in controlling and regulating their behavior — is an important factor. Without self-regulation, there is no control over one's behavior such in addiction. All those factors can differ between men and women and across age (groups). To examine the determinants, an empirical study was conducted among a Dutch population. A survey was conducted with 386 volunteer participants. To test the hypotheses, a structural equation modeling using Amos 20.0 was applied. The results suggest that smartphone addiction exists and it can develop through habits. Younger persons are more vulnerable with regard to developing an addiction, especially when they have higher levels of social stress, are weak at self-regulation, and extensively use their smartphones for social and process purposes. Furthermore, females are somewhat more sensitive to develop addiction because of higher rates in social stress and social usage typical of this gender group.The findings can be explained by differences in the generations. The younger generation, the Millenials, are grown up with digital innovations and rely (heavily) on digital sources. Social anxiety is thereby of importance, as it is a determinant of smartphone addiction, because persons use their smartphones as substitutes of other communication tools.},

There is increasing evidence that recognition is, in fact, based on two processes: recollection and familiarity. This article reviews the current state of the evidence for dual-process models, including the usefulness of the remember/know paradigm, and interprets the relevant results in terms of the source of activation confusion (SAC) model of memory. We argue that the evidence from each of the areas we discuss, when combined, presents a strong case that inclusion of a recollection process is necessary. Given this conclusion, we also argue that the dual-process claim that the recollection process is always available is, in fact, more parsimonious than the single-process claim that the recollection process is used only in certain paradigms. The value of a well-specified process model such as the SAC model is discussed with regard to other types of dual-process models.},

Experience design offers designers of online courses a comprehensive model informed by research and development in a number of areas that can provide a foundation for the effective design of online experiences that are functional and purposeful—and also engaging, compelling, memorable, and enjoyable. Experience design is an ancient practice, going back to the earliest human impulse to develop rituals, ceremonies, drama, and even architecture. But the design of experiences has become much more pervasive during the twentieth century. Media has played a central role, including radio, television, multimedia, and virtual reality. But experience design is also informed by new ideas in economics, especially Pine and Gilmore's notion of the emerging experience economy. And it draws upon ideas from artificial intelligence, the psychology of optimal experiences, sociology, and other areas, including electronic commerce, persuasive, human-computer interface design, drama, and digital storytelling. This article discusses key concepts and theories from all of these areas and explains how they can be adapted to the design of online learning experiences.},

complex, organic-like structures can evolve order and purpose over time.
Business organizations, typified by semi-autonomous organizational members
interacting at many levels of cognition and action, can be portrayed by the
generic constructs and driving mechanisms of complex adaptive systems theory.
The purpose of this paper is to forge a unified description of complex adaptive
systems from several sources, and then investigate the issue of change in a
business organization via the framework of complex adaptive systems. The
theory of complex adaptive systems uses components from three paradigms of
management thought: systems theory, population ecology, and information
processing. Specific propositions regarding the nature of dynamical change will
be developed, driven by the complex adaptive systems model. Supporting
evidence for these propositions is then sought within the existing management
theory literature. In doing so, the complex adaptive systems approach to
understanding organization change will be better grounded in domain-specific
theory, and new insights and research areas will come to light},

We also argue that this movement involves not only the challenges of engaging stakeholders as designers in the design process, as in “traditional” Participatory Design (i.e., envisioning “use before actual use,” for example, through prototyping), but also the chal- lenges of designing beyond the specific project and toward future stakeholders as designers (i.e., supporting ways to “design after design” in a specific project). We see this movement as one from “projecting” to one of “infrastructuring” design activities. As fur- ther reflections on these challenges, we discuss our ongoing “infrastructuring” engagement in Malmö Living Labs as one in which we design “Things” for social innovation. We conclude by returning to design thinking and exploring the further challenges to infrastructuring and to open “design Things.”},

Social cohesion (five items) was

counterargument cohesion:
In the cross-sectional model no relationship was found between
bureaucratic obstacles, social cohesion and functional communication and
both uncertainty constructs. Perhaps, bureaucratic obstacles become
apparent only after hands-on experience with self-management performance
criteria is gained, an idea supported by the results of the dynamic model (see
below).
The absence of any influence of social cohesion is
surprising. Kolb and Aiello (1993) found that cohesiveness of teams has a
positive impact on productivity, but Hyatt and Ruddy (1997) reported that
team-context variables might be more important to improve team
effectiveness than ensuring team members are ``cohesive''.},

We discuss the benefits and challenges of a fully portable system, including technical limitations as well as real-time reconstruction of 3D images of brain activity. We present examples of the brain activity captured in a simple experiment involving imagined finger tapping, showing that the acquired signal in a relevant brain region is similar to that obtained with standard EEG lab equipment. Although the quality of the signal in a mobile solution using a off-the-shelf consumer neuroheadset is lower compared to that obtained using high density standard EEG equipment, we propose that mobile application development may offset the disadvantages and provide completely new opportunities for neuroimaging in natural settings.},

They are seen as a 'global consumer phenomenon' with an exponential rise in usage within the last few years. Anecdotal case study evidence suggests that 'addiction' to social networks on the Internet may be a potential mental health problem for some users. However, the contemporary scientific literature addressing the addictive qualities of social networks on the Internet is scarce. Therefore, this literature review is intended to provide empirical and conceptual insight into the emerging phenomenon of addiction to SNSs by: (1) outlining SNS usage patterns, (2) examining motivations for SNS usage, (3) examining personalities of SNS users, (4) examining negative consequences of SNS usage, (5) exploring potential SNS addiction, and (6) exploring SNS addiction specificity and comorbidity. The findings indicate that SNSs are predominantly used for social purposes, mostly related to the maintenance of established offline networks. Moreover, extraverts appear to use social networking sites for social enhancement, whereas introverts use it for social compensation, each of which appears to be related to greater usage, as does low conscientiousness and high narcissism. Negative correlates of SNS usage include the decrease in real life social community participation and academic achievement, as well as relationship problems, each of which may be indicative of potential addiction.},

The two processes are distinguishable because the familiarity-based judgments are thought to be faster than the retrieval-based processes, because only retrieval-based JOLs should enhance the relative accuracy of the correlations between the JOLs and criterion test performance, and because only retrieval-based judgments should enhance memory. To test these predictions, in three experiments, the authors either speeded people's JOLs or allowed them to be unspeeded. The relative accuracy of the JOLs in predicting performance on the criterion test was higher for the unspeeded JOLs than for the speeded JOLs, as predicted. The unspeeded JOL conditions showed enhanced memory as compared with the speeded JOL conditions, as predicted. Finally, the unspeeded JOLs were sensitive to manipulations that modified recallability of the target, whereas the speeded JOLs were selectively sensitive to experimental variations in the familiarity of the cues. Thus, all three of the predictions about the consequences of the two processes potentially underlying delayed JOLs were borne out. A model of the processes underlying delayed JOLs based on these and earlier results is presented.},

The control-process view holds that people have a goal in mind and try to move toward it (or away from it), monitoring the extent to which a discrepancy remains between the goal and one's present state and taking steps to reduce the discrepancy (or enlarge it). Dynamic systems models tend to emphasize a bottom-up self-organization process, in which a coherence arises from among many simultaneous influences, moving the system toward attractors and away from repellers. We suggest that these differences in emphasis reflect two facets of a more complex reality involving both types of processes. Discussion focuses on how self-organization may occur within constituent elements of a feedback system--the input function, the output function, and goal values being used by the system--and how feedback processes themselves can reflect self-organizing tendencies.},

Here we discuss how afferent information from face and viscera influence the processing and communication of emotional states. We highlight (a) the fine-grained impact that facial muscular and patterned visceral responses exert on emotional appraisal and communicative signals; (b) short-term changes in visceral state that bias brain responses to emotive stimuli; (c) the commonality of brain pathways and substrates mediating short- and long-term bodily effects on emotional processes; (d) how topographically distinct representations of different bodily states are coupled to reported feelings associated with subtypes of disgust; and (e) how pupil signals contribute to affective exchange. Integrating these observations enriches our understanding of emotional processes and psychopathology.},

abstract = {What is the ideal body size and shape that we want for ourselves and our partners? What are the important physical features in this ideal? And do both genders agree on what is an attractive body? To answer these questions we used a 3D interactive software system which allows our participants to produce a photorealistic, virtual male or female body. Forty female and forty male heterosexual Caucasian observers (females mean age 19.10 years, s.d. 1.01; 40 males mean age 19.84, s.d. 1.66) set their own ideal size and shape, and the size and shape of their ideal partner using the DAZ studio image manipulation programme. In this programme the shape and size of a 3D body can be altered along 94 independent dimensions, allowing each participant to create the exact size and shape of the body they want. The volume (and thus the weight assuming a standard density) and the circumference of the bust, waist and hips of these 3D models can then be measured. The ideal female body set by women (BMI = 18.9, WHR = 0.70, WCR = 0.67) was very similar to the ideal partner set by men, particularly in their BMI (BMI = 18.8, WHR = 0.73, WCR = 0.69). This was a lower BMI than the actual BMI of 39 of the 40 women. The ideal male body set by the men (BMI = 25.9, WHR = 0.87, WCR = 0.74) was very similar to the ideal partner set by the women (BMI = 24.5, WHR = 0.86, WCR = 0.77). This was a lower BMI than the actual BMI of roughly half of the men and a higher BMI than the other half. The results suggest a consistent preference for an ideal male and female body size and shape across both genders. The results also suggest that both BMI and torso shape are important components for the creation of the ideal body.},

Hong Kong participants and 35 United Kingdom participants, with 56 male,
174 female and 3 failed to indicate their gender, mean age of 21.63
(SD=4.97). Participants were recruited to complete a set of psychometric
scales, namely Mobile Phone Problematic Use Scale, Behaviour Rating
Inventory of Executive Function, Beck Depression Inventory, and General
Health Questionnaire, to measure MPPU, executive function, depression,
and mental health respectively. The findings showed significant
correlation between variables and that participants who responded higher
in MPPU scored lower in all nine subscales of executive functions. High
scores in MPPU was also associated with higher level of depression,
mental health problems. Multiple regression found that depression
significantly predicted problematic smartphone use. In Cross-cultural
comparisons, Hong Kong participants reported using more expensive
smartphones than the United Kingdom counterparts. Hong Kong participants
who were high in MPPU tended to use more expensive smartphones. The
current findings contributed to previous research on MPPU, interference
in academic performance and negative influence on psychological
well-being. As smartphone use is becoming more prevalent, further
research on the intervention of MPPU is needed among college students to
be able to enhance their executive function and improve psychological
health.},

The experience of prior design failures was thought to encourage fixation whilst the experience of varied solutions was thought to discourage fixation. Recognising fixation episodes and reflecting on them was described as the means by which designers could guard against such episodes in the future and thus be more creative.},

This approach avoids pitfalls that are inherent when the order of the standard and the comparison is neglected in estimating the difference limen (DL), as in traditional approaches. The present article provides MATLAB and R routines that implement this novel procedure for estimating DLs. These routines also allow to account for processing failures such as lapses or finger errors and can be applied to experimental designs in which the standard and comparison differ only along the task-relevant dimension, as well as to designs in which the stimuli differ in more than one dimension. In addition, Monte Carlo simulations were conducted to check the quality of our routines. {\textcopyright}2012 Psychonomic Society, Inc.},

abstract = {Typicality and novelty have often been shown to be related to aesthetic preference of human artefacts. Since a typical product is rarely new and, conversely, a novel product will not often be designated as typical, the positive effects of both features seem incompatible. In three studies it was shown that typicality (operationalized as 'goodness of example') and novelty are jointly and equally effective in explaining the aesthetic preference of consumer products, but that they suppress each other's effect. Direct correlations between both variables and aesthetic preference were not significant, but each relationship became highly significant when the influence of the other variable was partialed out. In Study 2, it was furthermore demonstrated that the expertise level of observers did not affect the relative contribution of novelty and typicality. It was finally shown (Study 3) that a more 'objective' measure of typicality, central tendency operationalized as an exemplar's average similarity to all other members of the category - yielded the same effect of typicality on aesthetic preference. In sum, all three studies showed that people prefer novel designs as long as the novelty does not affect typicality, or, phrased differently, they prefer typicality given that this is not to the detriment of novelty. Preferred are products with an optimal combination of both aspects},

We test this hypothesis in a large and representative sample of Italian individuals. The results indicate that time spent with friends is worth less, in terms of life satisfaction, for individuals who use the smartphone. This finding is robust to the use of instrumental variables estimation to deal with possible endogeneity. We also show that, consistent with our hypothesis, the positive association between time spent with friends and satisfaction with friends is less strong for individuals who use the smartphone.},

Existing annotated databases of facial expressions in the wild are small and mostly cover discrete emotions (aka the categorical model). There are very limited annotated facial databases for affective computing in the continuous dimensional model (e.g., valence and arousal). To meet this need, we collected, annotated, and prepared for public distribution a new database of facial emotions in the wild (called AffectNet). AffectNet contains more than 1,000,000 facial images from the Internet by querying three major search engines using 1,250 emotion related keywords in six different languages. About half of the retrieved images were manually annotated for the presence of seven discrete facial expressions and the intensity of valence and arousal. AffectNet is by far the largest database of facial expression, valence, and arousal in the wild enabling research in automated facial expression recognition in two different emotion models. Two baseline deep neural networks are used to classify images in the categorical model and predict the intensity of valence and arousal. Various evaluation metrics show that our deep neural network baselines can perform better than conventional machine learning methods and off-the-shelf facial expression recognition systems.},

Specifically, the most prevailing influence on CRM acceptance comes from CRM perceived usefulness, followed by the setting of accurate expectations regarding system usage, the salesperson innovativeness towards new technological tools, the CRM perceived ease-of-use, and the supervisor encouragement and support. Surprisingly, the model does not adequately explicate salesperson performance. Sales managers are presented with a discussion and implications of the findings.},

abstract = {In this meta-analysis, we give a comprehensive overview of the effects of meditation on psychological variables that can be extracted from empirical studies, concentrating on the effects of meditation on nonclinical groups of adult meditators. Mostly because of methodological problems, almost ¾ of an initially identified 595 studies had to be excluded. Most studies appear to have been conducted without sufficient theoretical background. To put the results into perspective, we briefly summarize the major theoretical approaches from both East and West. The 163 studies that allowed the calculation of effect sizes exhibited medium average effects (r = .28 for all studies and r = .27 for the n = 125 studies from reviewed journals), which cannot be explained by mere relaxation or cognitive restructuring effects. In general, results were strongest (medium to large) for changes in emotionality and relationship issues, less strong (about medium) for measures of attention, and weakest (small to medium) for more cognitive measures. However, specific findings varied across different approaches to meditation (transcendental meditation, mindfulness meditation, and other meditation techniques). Surprisingly, meditation experience only partially covaried with long-term impact on the variables examined. In general, the dependent variables used cover only some of the content areas about which predictions can be made from already existing theories about meditation; still, such predictions lack precision at present. We conclude that to arrive at a comprehensive understanding of why and how meditation works, emphasis should be placed on the development of more precise theories and measurement devices.},

In contrast, beauty largely depended on identification; a hedonic attribute group, which captures the product's ability to communicate important personal values to relevant others.

Both perceptions of the efficacy of recommended actions and the confidence individuals have in their ability to carry out prevention and detection practices may be associated with beliefs about illness causation.

abstract = {The concept of design thinking (DT) has emerged in management debates as promising innovation inspired by the way designers work. Despite the growing interest in DT, it is a difficult concept to study due to the lack of coherence between what DT ‘is' in academic and practical terms. While there are numerous normative and often process-focused depictions of DT, they seemlimited in their ability to account forwhat occurs in practice.Given the discussion of DT as a concept, and emerging discussion of its enactment, a framing is needed that acknowledges both aspects. This paper proposes a framing of DT that makes it researchable in both theory and practice, and discusses commonalities and discrepancies in how the concept is usually portrayed in the literature. The paper builds on an empirical interviewstudy in six large organizations, which led to the development of a framework structure and the identification of five themes characterizing DT: User focus, Problem framing, Visualization, Experimentation and Diversity. Each theme is associated with specific principles/mindsets, practices and techniques.Themain contribution of this paper is to propose a framework that includesDT both as an idea and as the enactment of the idea, inspired by the works of Latour.

abstract = {Aesthetic preferences are ubiquitous in visual experience. Indeed, it seems nearly impossible in many circumstances to perceive a scene without also liking or disliking it to some degree. Aesthetic factors are only occasionally studied in mainstream vision science, though, and even then they are often treated as functionally independent fromother aspects of perception. In contrast, the present study explores the possibility that aesthetic preferences may interact with other types of visual processing. We were inspired, in particular, by the inward bias in aesthetic preferences: When an object with a salient “front” is placed near the border of a frame (say, in a photograph), observers tend to find the image more aesthetically pleasing if the object faces inward (toward the center) than if it faces outward (away from the center).We employed similar stimuli, except that observers viewed framed figures that were ambiguous in terms of the direction they appeared to be facing. The resulting percepts were influenced by the frames in a way that corresponded to the inward bias: When a figure was placed near a frame's border, observers tended to see whichever interpretation was facing inward. This effect occurred for both abstract geometric figures (e.g., ambiguously-oriented triangles) and meaningful line drawings (e.g., left-facing ducks or right-facing rabbits). The match between this new influence on ambiguous figure perception and the previously studied aesthetic bias suggests new ways in which aesthetic factors may relate not only to what we like, but also to what we see in the first place.},

abstract = {Extreme programming (XP), similarly to other agile software development methods, values close collaboration with customers. One of the XP practices suggests that the customer should be 100{\{}{\%}{\}} available for the development team. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the XP customer role is costly, difficult and demanding. However, very few empirical studies have been published on the role of customer in an XP project. The results of this controlled case study are in line with the common belief that the on-site customerrsquos role is indeed demanding, requiring a strong ability to resolve issues rapidly. Yet, the study also offers contrasting findings in terms of required actual customer involvement in the development project. This empirical case demonstrates that while the customer was present close to 100{\{}{\%}{\}} with the development team, only 21{\{}{\%}{\}} of his work effort was required to assist the team in the development. However, it is also shown that an on-site customer may create a false sense of confidence in the system under development. The implications of these and other findings are discussed.

A Bayesian Network Based business information retrieval model (BN-BIRM) is proposed by means of Bayesian network (BN) and information retrieval (IR) theory and a method for query adaptation is presented. In this model the customized query requirement of enterprise (CQR) is expressed in terms of the predefined illustrative documents related to business domain. The similarities between the documents and the query are evaluated with the conditional probabilities among the nodes in the BN. In the experiments, BN-BIRM is compared with the Belief Network model based on vector space model (VSM) ranking strategy and the Inference Network model based on TF-IDF ranking strategy. The experimental results show that BN-BIRM is effective for collecting business information on a large scale. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag London Limited 2008.},

They conclude that evaluating the likely quality of an intuitive judgment requires an assessment of the predictability of the environment in which the judgment is made and of the individual's opportunity to learn the regularities of that environment. Subjective experience is not a reliable indicator of judgment accuracy.},

Exploring spontaneous uses promises to improve our understanding of both the deeper integration of the smartphone into mundane activities, as well as the smartphone's potential for distraction and interruption. Therefore, we studied the user experience of unplanned smartphone use to unpack its experience qualities. For capturing unplanned use from a first-person perspective, 36 participants each produced two hours of continuous video recordings with wearable cameras. The findings introduced the experience quality of 'timelessness,' a feeling that unplanned smartphone use is a series of unrelated moments, lacking a coherent sense of past, present, and future. Unplanned use usually leaves no memory of what it was, presents no attributes of what it is, and projects no endings of what it will be. The study contributes a theoretical framework of unplanned use for experience design.},

abstract = {Recent research endeavors have shown the potential of using feed-forward convolutional neural networks to ac-complish fast style transfer for images. In this work, we take one step further to explore the possibility of exploiting a feed-forward network to perform style transfer for videos and simultaneously maintain temporal consistency among stylized video frames. Our feed-forward network is trained by enforcing the outputs of consecutive frames to be both well stylized and temporally consistent. More specifically, a hybrid loss is proposed to capitalize on the content in-formation of input frames, the style information of a given style image, and the temporal information of consecutive frames. To calculate the temporal loss during the train-ing stage, a novel two-frame synergic training mechanism is proposed. Compared with directly applying an existing image style transfer method to videos, our proposed method employs the trained network to yield temporally consistent stylized videos which are much more visually pleasant. In contrast to the prior video style transfer method which relies on time-consuming optimization on the fly, our method runs in real time while generating competitive visual results.},

Participants were asked to generate abstract categories before they brainstormed either in groups or individually in Experiment 1. It was expected that generating categories before ideation would be beneficial. However, it was found that category generation harmed the group ideation process. Prior category generation reduced clustering of ideas within categories for groups, which might have led to a decrease in productivity. The last two experiments examined whether groups would benefit by brainstorming one category at a time because this might increase clustering. It was found that sequential category brainstorming helped increase productivity during the ideation process and increased clustering. These studies demonstrate that a prior categorization phase can facilitate subsequent brainstorming because it enhances sub-sequent clustering of ideas within categories.},

This is especially true for initial courtship encounters when pairs report a sense of interpersonal chemistry.The authors explore the process of romantic bonding by applying interaction ritual theory, extended and integrated with methods from computational linguistics, to the study of courtship encounters and, specifically, heterosexual speed dating. The authors find that the assortment of interpersonal moves associated with a sense of connection characterizes a conventionalized form of initial courtship activity. The game is successfully played when females are the point of focus and engaged in the conversation and males demonstrate alignment with and understanding of the female. In short, initial heterosexual courtship encounters are associated with a sense of bonding when they reflect a reciprocal asymmetrical performance in which differentiated roles are mutually coordinated. {\textcopyright} 2013 by The University of Chicago.

However, recent empirical work (Wason and Johnson-Laird, 1972) suggests the existence of a confirmation bias, at least on abstract problems. Using a more realistic, computer controlled environment modeled after a real research setting, subjects in this study first formulated hypotheses about the laws governing events occurring in the environment. They then chose between pairs of environments in which they could: (I) make observations which would probably confirm these hypotheses, or (2) test alternative hypotheses. Strong evidence for a confirmation bias involving failure to choose environments allowing tests of alternative hypotheses was found. However, when subjects did obtain explicit falsifying information, they used this information to reject incorrect hypotheses.},

Aﬀect was moderately related, as well as performance outcomes, and motives were weakly correlated. Many of the eﬀect size categories were heterogeneous, indicating that moderators may play a role. However, the majority of studies did not account for moderators.

abstract = {Social behavior is ordinarily treated as being under conscious (if not always thoughtful) control. However, considerable evidence now supports the view that social behavior often operates in an implicit or unconscious fashion. The identifying feature of implicit cognition is that past experience influences judgment in a fashion not introspectively known by the actor. The present conclusion--that attitudes, self-esteem, and stereotypes have important implicit modes of operation--extends both the construct validity and predictive usefulness of these major theoretical constructs of social psychology. Methodologically, this review calls for increased use of indirect measures--which are imperative in studies of implicit cognition. The theorized ordinariness of implicit stereotyping is consistent with recent findings of discrimination by people who explicitly disavow prejudice. The finding that implicit cognitive effects are often reduced by focusing judges' attention on their judgment task provides a basis for evaluating applications (such as affirmative action) aimed at reducing such unintended discrimination.

abstract = {Multi-emotion sentiment classification is a natural language processing (NLP) problem with valuable use cases on real-world data. We demonstrate that large-scale unsupervised language modeling combined with finetuning offers a practical solution to this task on difficult datasets, including those with label class imbalance and domain-specific context. By training an attention-based Transformer network (Vaswani et al. 2017) on 40GB of text (Amazon reviews) (McAuley et al. 2015) and fine-tuning on the training set, our model achieves a 0.69 F1 score on the SemEval Task 1:E-c multi-dimensional emotion classification problem (Mohammad et al. 2018), based on the Plutchik wheel of emotions (Plutchik 1979). These results are competitive with state of the art models, including strong F1 scores on difficult (emotion) categories such as Fear (0.73), Disgust (0.77) and Anger (0.78), as well as competitive results on rare categories such as Anticipation (0.42) and Surprise (0.37). Furthermore, we demonstrate our application on a real world text classification task. We create a narrowly collected text dataset of real tweets on several topics, and show that our finetuned model outperforms general purpose commercially available APIs for sentiment and multidimensional emotion classification on this dataset by a significant margin. We also perform a variety of additional studies, investigating properties of deep learning architectures, datasets and algorithms for achieving practical multidimensional sentiment classification. Overall, we find that unsupervised language modeling and finetuning is a simple framework for achieving high quality results on real-world sentiment classification.},

abstract = {A design studio is a critical venue for design students, as they are educated to develop design thinking and other skills through studio courses. This article introduces a design studio project in which Korean and Malaysian students worked jointly for one semester to design affordable urban housing. The Korean students were interior design majors and the Malaysian students were architecture majors; thus it was thought that the students' areas of expertise were likely to differ. It was also anticipated that the students would display cultural differences in terms of housing and planning practices. The motive for starting the joint design studio was the idea that a cross-cultural collaborative working setting could redefine students' thinking styles and stimulate students to obtain non-routine perspectives on the design of buildings and spaces. Through observation and interviews, we explored how students tackled affordable housing problems within the context of cross-cultural and interdisciplinary design education. Collaborative learning in a joint studio situation supplemented students' expertise, re-orienting approaches to design and opening up a holistic approach to the design issues of affordability, sustainability and community. Overall, the practical learning in the joint studio project validated the importance of exploring alternative solutions based on varied levels of information, and input of those from different educational and cultural backgrounds. The cross-cultural and interdisciplinary collaboration allowed for a previously unavailable enhancement of design education by encouraging students to obtain divergent thinking for innovative design ideas.},

The percentages of male (47.0{\%}) and female (53.0{\%}) participants were about equal, and the mean age was 38.56 years (SD = 11.87). The results show that the SWLS has a high internal consistency reliability, a one-factor structure (with a wording effect on Items 4 and 5), strict invariance across gender, partial strict invariance across education (Items 1, 2 and 3), and partial strong invariance across age, income (Items 1, 2 and 3) and residential region (Items 1 and 2). The non-invariance of some items across age and region is discussed in terms of the rapid economic and social transitions of China in the past three decades.

abstract = {User generated content (UGC), now with millions of video producers and consumers, is reshaping the way people watch video and TV. In particular, UGC sites are creating new viewing patterns and social interactions, empowering users to be more creative, and generating new business opportunities. Compared to traditional video-on-demand (VoD) systems, UGC services allow users to request videos from a potentially unlimited selection in an asynchronous fashion. To better understand the impact of UGC services, we have analyzed the world's largest UGC VoD system, YouTube, and a popular similar system in Korea, Daum Videos. In this paper, we first empirically show how UGC services are fundamentally different from traditional VoD services. We then analyze the intrinsic statistical properties of UGC popularity distributions and discuss opportunities to leverage the latent demand for niche videos (or the so-called "the Long Tail" potential), which is not reached today due to information filtering or other system scarcity distortions. Based on traces collected across multiple days, we study the popularity lifetime of UGC videos and the relationship between requests and video age. Finally, we measure the level of content aliasing and illegal content in the system and show the problems aliasing creates in ranking the video popularity accurately. The results presented in this paper are crucial to understanding UGC VoD systems and may have major commercial and technical implications for site administrators and content owners.},

The two experiments reported here examined the hypothesis that the type of source information being tested mediates the magnitude of age differences in source memory. In these studies, participants listened to statements made by two different speakers. We compared younger and older adults' source memory in a traditional perceptual source task (memory for voice) and in two affective, conceptually based source tasks (truth of the statements, character of a person in a photo). In both studies, the perceptual and conceptual source information were conveyed in the same manner, as one speaker was associated with one type of information (e.g., female voice speaks truth). Age differences were robust for decisions regarding who said each statement but were negligible for truth or character decisions. These findings are provocative because they suggest that the type of information can influence age-related patterns of performance for source-conveyed information.},

abstract = {This paper considers different ways of approaching service design, exploring what professional designers who say they design services are doing. First it reviews literature in the design and management fields, including marketing and operations. The paper proposes a framework that clarifies key tensions shaping the understanding of service design. It then presents an ethnographic study of three firms of professional service designers and details their work in three case studies. The paper reports four findings. The designers approached services as entities that are both social and material. The designers in the study saw service as relational and temporal and thought of value as created in practice. They approached designing a service through a constructivist enquiry in which they sought to understand the experiences of stakeholders and they tried to involve managers in this activity. The paper proposes describing designing for service as a particular kind of service design. Designing for service is seen as an exploratory process that aims to create new kinds of value relation between diverse actors within a socio-material configuration. This has implications for existing ways of understanding design and for research, practice and teaching. {\textcopyright} 2011 Kimbell.},

Stogdill (1972) suggested that effort that is devoted to the social development of the group is subtracted from effort devoted to the task. Zaccaro and McCoy (1988) also investigated the effects of interpersonal and task cohesiveness on performance on a disjunctive task. Disjunctive tasks are tasks in which group performance is determined by the performance of the group's best member. Eureka problems, for which there is an intuitively correct and obvious answer, exemplify the disjunctive task type. For the best member to benefit the group, two conditions must be met: (a) The group member must be committed to the task, and (b)

the group member must feel that the group will be accepting of Jhe new idea. Therefore, task cohesiveness should benefit performance through increased task commitment and increased individual effort. However, interpersonal cohesiveness also should benefit the group through open communication and acceptance of ideas. Thus, Zaccaro and McCoy (1988) hypothesized that both task cohesiveness and interpersonal cohesiveness would be necessary for the group to perform well.},

abstract = { What is the basic structure of emotional experience and how is it represented in the human brain? One highly influential theory, discrete basic emotions, proposes a limited set of basic emotions such as happiness and fear, which are characterized by unique physiological and neural profiles. Although many studies using diverse methods have linked particular brain structures with specific basic emotions, evidence from individual neuroimaging studies and from neuroimaging meta-analyses has been inconclusive regarding whether basic emotions are associated with both consistent and discriminable regional brain activations. We revisited this question, using activation likelihood estimation (ALE), which allows spatially sensitive, voxelwise statistical comparison of results from multiple studies. In addition, we examined substantially more studies than previous meta-analyses. The ALE meta-analysis yielded results consistent with basic emotion theory. Each of the emotions examined (fear, anger, disgust, sadness, and happiness) was characterized by consistent neural correlates across studies, as defined by reliable correlations with regional brain activations. In addition, the activation patterns associated with each emotion were discrete (discriminable from the other emotions in pairwise contrasts) and overlapped substantially with structure–function correspondences identified using other approaches, providing converging evidence that discrete basic emotions have consistent and discriminable neural correlates. Complementing prior studies that have demonstrated neural correlates for the affective dimensions of arousal and valence, the current meta-analysis results indicate that the key elements of basic emotion views are reflected in neural correlates identified by neuroimaging studies. },

Higher scores on self-control correlated with a higher grade point average, better adjustment (fewer reports of psychopathology, higher self-esteem), less binge eating and alcohol abuse, better relationships and interpersonal skills, secure attachment, and more optimal emotional responses. Tests for curvilinearity failed to indicate any drawbacks of so-called overcontrol, and the positive effects remained after controlling for social desirability. Low self-control is thus a significant risk factor for a broad range of personal and interpersonal problems.},

When the averaged effect size of each study was weighted with the sample size of that study, the weighted grand mean effect size was 0.72. The important findings were: (a) the mean effect sizes associated with problem-solving creativity and verbal creativity were significantly larger than those associated with emotional creativity and nonverbal creativity, (b) variables having a large mean effect size were prestige of honors/awards, working circumstances favorable for creativity, defining problem, and retrieving knowledge, (c) most of the mean effect sizes of the problem solving procedures on the measures of problem solving exceeded the medium (0.5) of Cohen's guidelines.

We conducted a preliminary (n = 18) and final (n = 32) experiment with international students of business. These experiments revealed that priming of brainstorming by a persona increases originality of ideas by a large effect size (Cohen's d = .91, p = .02), and not significantly ideational fluency by a medium effect size (Cohen's d = .33, p = .39). As an alternative explanation to empathy, the found creativity effect may be attributed to priming that retrieves related memory items and there- by facilitates idea generation. As practical implications, design thinking practitioners can expect more original ideas and overcome design fixation if they brainstorm on a persona which is modelled in a concise and consistent way that caters to understanding the user need.},

Although Exp 1 failed to find a closing of the productivity gap over time in equal man-hour comparisons, real 4-person groups produced more than nominal groups when given 4 times as much time. Because lengthening the time of session increases thinking as well as speaking time, speaking time was manipulated in Exp 2. The finding that individuals who brainstormed for 20 min but were allowed to talk either for all or for only 25{\%} of the time did not differ in productivity eliminates differences in speaking time as an explanation of the productivity loss in idea-generating groups. In Exps 3 and 4, procedural strategies to lessen the impact of blocking were examined.},

abstract = {A huge number of informal messages are posted every day in social network sites,blogs,and discussion forums. Emotions seem to be frequently important in these texts for expressing friendship, showing social support or as part of online arguments. Algorithms to identify senti- ment and sentiment strength are needed to help under- stand the role of emotion in this informal communication and also to identify inappropriate or anomalous affec- tive utterances, potentially associated with threatening behavior to the self or others. Nevertheless, existing sentiment detection algorithms tend to be commercially oriented, designed to identify opinions about products rather than user behaviors.This article partly fills this gap with a new algorithm, SentiStrength, to extract sentiment strength from informal English text, using new methods to exploit the de facto grammars and spelling styles of cyberspace. Applied to MySpace comments and with a lookup table of term sentiment strengths optimized by machine learning, SentiStrength is able to predict posi- tive emotion with 60.6{\%} accuracy and negative emotion with 72.8{\%} accuracy, both based upon strength scales of 1–5. The former, but not the latter, is better than baseline and a wide range of general machine learning approaches.},

abstract = {Conversation is a fundamental human experience that is necessary to pursue intrapersonal and interpersonal goals across myriad contexts, relationships, and modes of communication. In the current research, we isolate the role of an understudied conversational behavior: question-asking. Across 3 studies of live dyadic conversations, we identify a robust and consistent relationship between question-asking and liking: people who ask more questions, particularly follow-up questions, are better liked by their conversation partners. When people are instructed to ask more questions, they are perceived as higher in responsiveness, an interpersonal construct that captures listening, understanding, validation, and care. We measure responsiveness with an attitudinal measure from previous research as well as a novel behavioral measure: the number of follow-up questions one asks. In both cases, responsiveness explains the effect of question-asking on liking. In addition to analyzing live get-to-know-you conversations online, we also studied face-to-face speed-dating conversations. We trained a natural language processing algorithm as a "follow-up question detector" that we applied to our speed-dating data (and can be applied to any text data to more deeply understand question-asking dynamics). The follow-up question rate established by the algorithm showed that speed daters who ask more follow-up questions during their dates are more likely to elicit agreement for second dates from their partners, a behavioral indicator of liking. We also find that, despite the persistent and beneficial effects of asking questions, people do not anticipate that question-asking increases interpersonal liking.},

A total of 262 team members were surveyed from 72 hospital project teams. The results demonstrated that high cooperation teams differed from low cooperation teams both in terms of their increased use of informal methods for communication as well as their reasons for communicating. Finally, cross-functional cooperation was found to be a strong predictor of certain project outcomes.},

To define and explore this approach, the article is organized into three main sections: it presents an overview of key definitions in socially responsible design (SRD); it clarifies what is meant by dialogical relations; and it presents the methodological framework and results of an exploration into the use of a dialogical approach to SRD carried out on the campus of the authors' university. It not only exemplifies the application of this approach in a specific local context, but also illustrates how an understanding of dialogical relations might contribute to education in SRD.},

Using an Ambiguous Situations Task, the findings revealed that European American children attending homogeneous schools displayed racial bias in their interpretations of ambiguous situations as well as in their evaluations of cross-race friendship. Bias was not found, however, in the interpretations and evaluations of European American or African American children from heterogeneous schools. This study is the first to empirically demonstrate significant and direct relationships between intergroup contact in the school environment and children's intergroup biases as well as judgments about the potential for cross-race friendships.},

In experiments in which the emotional valence of encoded materials was manipulated with their arousal levels controlled, valence produced a continuum of memory falsification. 
Falsification was highest for negative materials, intermediate for neutral materials, and lowest for positive materials. 
Conjoint-recognition analysis produced a simple process-level explanation:

As one progresses from positive to neutral to negative valence, false memory increases because 
(a) the perceived meaning resemblance between false and true items increases and 
(b) subjects are less able to use verbatim memories of true items to suppress errors.},

A thinkLet is a codified facilitation technique that can be used to support a group collaboration process. In the first thinkLet, free brainstorming, four-member groups worked on their own without any form of external interaction. In the three subsequent thinkLets, the group interaction was "directed" by a facilitator who provided carefully constructed stimuli to similar four-member groups at specific timed intervals. The only difference between the directed thinkLets was the specific ordering of the stimuli set. A number of useful measurements that may be made during the course of comparing the relative effectiveness of these creativity thinkLets are discussed and compared within the context of a theoretical model. The differences among the various thinkLets are then used to offer advice for practitioners.},

The literature has suggested that people's preferences for such ‘cross-category' design styles are influenced by social distinctions, based on education level and age bracket. In this article, we have argued more precisely that such social distinctions are indispensable as criteria for an analysis of cross-category design styles. In a quantitative study with over 400 people and 200 products in 10 product categories, we have demonstrated how design preferences across product categories are related to people's education level and age bracket. We then qualitatively analysed people's design preferences across product categories, and we arrived at seven cross-category design styles. Five of these styles could be identified only on the basis of the differences in design preferences between groups of a different age and education level, as established in previous studies. Taken together, this article has provided an approach for designers to analyse cross-category design styles, based on the inclusion of social distinction indicators (education level and age bracket) that help identify critical differences in people's tastes.},

Aside from the online adjustment of cognitive control widely discussed in the literature, an additional mechanism of preventive goal shielding is suggested that circumvents irrelevant information from being processed in the first place. Participants had to react to 8 different words depicting clothing items that were presented in front of line drawings that could be either semantically related (clothes) or unrelated (animals with spatial orientation) to the target words. Participants either learned the stimulus-response (S-R) mappings by heart or used 1 task set (TS). In the S-R group, semantically related and unrelated distractors interfered with performance, whereas in the TS group, only semantically related distractors interfered, and unrelated distractors had no effect. It follows that task representations based on a general TS help to focus attention on relevant information, thereby preventing the processing of irrelevant information.},

abstract = {Witnessing the distress of others can result both in empathy and personal distress. Perspective-taking has been assigned a major role in the elicitation and modulation of these vicarious responses. However, little is known about how perspective-taking affects the psychophysiological correlates of empathy vs. personal distress. We recorded facial electromyographic and electrocardiographic activity while participants watched videos of patients undergoing painful sonar treatment. These videos were watched using two distinct perspectives: a) imagining the patient's feelings ('imagine other'), or b) imagining to be in the patient's place ('imagine self'). The results revealed an unspecific frowning response as well as activity over the M. orbicularis oculi region which was specific to the 'imagine self' perspective. This indicates that the pain-related tightening of the patients orbits was matched by participants when adopting this perspective. Our findings provide a physiological explanation for the more direct personal involvement and higher levels of personal distress associated with putting oneself explicitly into someone elses shoes. They provide further evidence that empathy does not only rely on automatic processes, but is also strongly influenced by top-down control and cognitive processes. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The explosion of image data on the Internet has the potential to foster more sophisticated and robust models and algorithms to index, retrieve, organize and interact with images and multimedia data. But exactly how such data can be harnessed and organized remains a critical problem. We introduce here a new database called ldquoImageNetrdquo, a large-scale ontology of images built upon the backbone of the WordNet structure. ImageNet aims to populate the majority of the 80,000 synsets of WordNet with an average of 500-1000 clean and full resolution images. This will result in tens of millions of annotated images organized by the semantic hierarchy of WordNet. This paper offers a detailed analysis of ImageNet in its current state: 12 subtrees with 5247 synsets and 3.2 million images in total. We show that ImageNet is much larger in scale and diversity and much more accurate than the current image datasets. Constructing such a large-scale database is a challenging task. We describe the data collection scheme with Amazon Mechanical Turk. Lastly, we illustrate the usefulness of ImageNet through three simple applications in object recognition, image classification and automatic object clustering. We hope that the scale, accuracy, diversity and hierarchical structure of ImageNet can offer unparalleled opportunities to researchers in the computer vision community and beyond.},

As an illustration of the breadth of its applicability, the basic construct of control theory--the discrepancy-reducing feedback loop--is presented, and certain implications for theory in 3 areas of human psychology are discussed. In personality-social, clinical, and health psychology, the construct proves to fit well with known phenomena and with the theories most recently developed to account for the phenomena. Moreover, in each case control theory appears to make a unique contribution to the state of the area.

abstract = {Background In this article, we provide two views on product design engineering education of two design educators from Korea and Australia. We argue that industrial design and engineering design need to be combined in order to support a total design philosophy that aims to improve design education. Therefore, the changing direction of design education for a total design perspective — and Korean and Australian design education — including industry situations are discussed. Product design education in Korea has focused on developing the physical appearance of a product. The concept of engineering design was recently introduced in Korea, and most design schools still belong to art schools. Nowadays, Korean industry is required to develop new businesses in the manufacturing sector, as the industry is facing the situation where ‘fast follower' strategy does not work for sustained growth and ultimately sustained success. This has grabbed the attention of product design engineers who can develop creative designs and materialize the concepts. In contrast, Australia is facing the end of a mining boom as well as a significant decline in automotive manufacturing. This has forced industry to challenge innovation in manufacturing which has generally been made up of SMEs. As such, the role of product design engineering is emphasized. We conclude that product design engineering education with industrial design and mechanical engineering can be primitive to strengthen the competitiveness of the manufacturing industry in both countries. Methods The views provided in this article were assembled from the existing literature, and based on our current experience of running design engineering convergence education programs in undergraduate and graduate levels. In general, the arguments made in this article are not attracted from theoretical and empirical research. They are rather based on our own perspectives of design engineering education. Thus, the views can be more critically based on holistic analyses of industry situations. Results {\&} Conclusions In this article, we examine that how a strong and well-defined product design engineering program within a university context can add significant value to the industry. Product design engineering is a hybrid program that combines analytical engineering sciences with creative industrial design capabilities. It provides a platform that can reshape product offerings for companies that seek to diversify or expand into new markets. Product design engineering links seamlessly toward current industry needs by producing creative design engineers at the forefront of innovation},

abstract = {Authors within the fields of cyberpsychology and human−computer interaction have demonstrated a particu- lar interest in measurement and scale creation, and exploratory factor analysis (EFA) is an extremely important statistical method for these areas of research. Unfortunately, EFA requires several statistical and methodological decisions to which the best choices are often unclear. The current article reviews five primary decisions and provides direct suggestions for best practices. These decisions are (a) the data inspection techniques, (b) the factor analytic method, (c) the factor retention method, (d) the factor rotation method, and (e) the factor loading cutoff. Then the article reviews authors' choices for these five EFA decisions in every relevant article within seven cyberpsychology and/or human–computer interaction journals. The results demonstrate that authors do not employ the recommended best practices for most decisions. Particularly, most authors do not inspect their data for violations of assumptions, apply inappropriate factor analytic methods, utilize outdated factor retention methods, and omit the justification for their factor rotation methods. Further, many authors omit altogether their EFA decisions. To rectify these concerns, the current article provides a step-by-step guide and checklist that authors can reference to ensure the use of recommended best practices.

abstract = {A key question in research on empathy is what interpersonal motivations might be activated by empathy. Does empathy promote only a concern with other's outcomes ("altruism"), as well as decreased concern with one's own outcomes ("selflessness"), or an increased concern with equality in outcomes ("egalitarianism")? These interpersonal motivations were assessed with a series of experimental games, and our manipulations of empathy paralleled earlier research on the empathy-altruism model. Participants received a (fictitious) note from another person outlining that he or she is coping with the anticipated loss of his or her father in conditions that emphasized taking the other's perspective or an objective perspective (high and low empathy), whereas another group of participants received no note (no empathy). Consistent with our hypotheses, results revealed that a concern with another's well-being (altruism) was greater in the two empathy conditions than in the no-empathy condition. Further, the authors observed no effect of empathy on selfishness or egalitarianism, two motivations that were substantially present independent of empathy. Thus, the findings suggest that empathy adds altruistic motivation to already existing selfish and egalitarian motivation.},

Experts, whether college students or Grade 6 children, devoted their time to items that were more difficult than did novices. However, in a multiple-trials experiment, people regressed toward easier items on Trial 2 rather than shifting to more difficult items, perhaps because Trial 1 feedback revealed poor learning of the easiest items.

Autonomy!
Central to work team design and management, autonomy is usually described by reference to three categories: (a)
Semi-autonomous groups are supervisor-led (Cherry, 1982); (b) self-regulating or self-managing groups elect their leaders and control their division of labor (Pearce {\{}{\&}{\}}amp; Ravlin, 1987); and (c) self-designing teams have authority over their definitions as work units and external relations (Hackman, 1987).

Performance Feedback: Agile Fit! 
Practitioners agree that team effectiveness depends on accurate, timely feedback on performance (Ketchum, 1984; Kolodny {\{}{\&}{\}}amp; Kiggundu, 1980) despite limited research evidence (Dyer, 1984).
Performance feedback requires dependable measurement systems. These are probably most feasible in teams with repetitive, quantifiable output and short cycles of work},

abstract = {The task performance-satisfaction relationship was examined from a control-
theory perspective. We hypothesized that performance and satisfaction would
be more highly related when goals were used as predictors than when per­
formance alone was used to predict satisfaction, because goal-performance
discrepancies rather than absolute performance should affect satisfaction. To
test this hypothesis, data from two studies were analyzed using hierarchical
regression analyses. Results strongly support the hypothesis, showing that
performance and satisfaction are strongly related in a positive manner when
goal level is considered. Practical implications and the extension of this ap­
proach to understanding satisfaction with other job facets were discussed.

Job satisfaction and the relationship of satisfaction to performance has
been a topic of major concern to many organizational researchers. Despite
years of research, recent meta-analytic reviews have shown that job satisfac­
tion and performance are only slightly correlated (r = .15; Iaffaldano {\&}
Muchinsky, 1985; Petty, McGee, {\&} Cavender, 1984). Part of the failure to
uncover consistent or strong correlations between performance and satis­
faction may be related to how the two variables are measured ( Fisher,
1980). Researchers have attempted to correlate a general attitude measure
(overall job satisfaction) with a very specific behavior (a single measure of
job performance). Drawing from Fishbein and Ajzen ( 1975 ) work on atti­

This literature supports a simulation theory of empathy, which proposes that we understand the thoughts and feelings of others by using our own mind as a model. In contrast, theory of mind research suggests that medial prefrontal regions are critical for understanding the minds of others.

Social Cohesion
Although a natural division based upon the task interaction of athletic
groups led to predictions for the GEQ's task-cohesion scales, the same was not
true for social cohesion. In examining social cohesion, one finds no natural, sport
organized, social interaction differentiation. However, an extreme-groups design
was used to maximize the influence of variables known to affect the social cohesion
a group develops. Thus, predictive validity hypotheses about the GEQ's social
scales could be advanced. The focal variable was length of membership (i.e.,
time spent in the group). The time that group members have spent with their group
should differentially affect their social interaction and their related perceptions
of social cohesion.
In the group dynamics literature, Sherif and Sherif (1969) have noted that
situational factors such as task goals and interaction play a greater role in affecting
group behavior in the early stages of the group's life. However, as the group
matures over time, social norms, values, and motives begin to play a larger role
in affecting behavior. Thus for sport teams, it was reasoned that the natural task
orientation of the sport would initially focus team members' primary energies
on task interaction. By contrast, at a later stage of group development when players
had remained with their team, patterns of task interaction would become more
stable relative to those of newly formed groups. By this time team members could
begin to redistribute some of their energies toward social interactions with their
teammates. At this later stage of development, long-standing team members might
be more likely to perceive their team as a social as well as a task unit and perceive
that their team was fulfilling some of the social needs of the individual team member.

If the GEQ social scales could discriminate between athletes who had been
with their team on a long-standing basis and athletes new to their team, this would
constitute predictive validity evidence. Differences in social cohesion should be
greatest between the most long-standing and the newest team members. The former
should be more socially cohesive than the latter because greater time together
allows social norms and values to develop. It was unclear how social cohesion
might also vary between team and individual sports. Thus no prediction was advanced
in this regard.},

abstract = {The recent discovery by neuroscientists of mirror neurons has launched a spate of scientific investigations. A keystone of the therapeutic process of dance/movement therapy (D/MT), the concept of mirroring is now the subject of neuroscience. An interactive phenomenon, studies are revealing that the identical sets of neurons can be activated in an individual who is simply witnessing another person performing a movement as the one actually engaged in the action or the expression of some emotion or behavior. The domains of behavior currently under investigation span motoric, psychosocial and cognitive functions, including specific psychosocial issues related to attunement, attachment theory and empathy. Although D/MT embodies empathic forms, until recently their neurological underpinnings have not been studied. The paper addresses the theoretical constructs of the mirror matching mechanism and empathy, and the implications for D/MT. Beginning with the basic mapping of important central nervous system structures and their behavioral functions, the focus shifts to the mirror neurons with respect to the formative years vis-??-vis the developmental issues of empathy-attachment, attunement, social cognition and morality. The final section offers two exemplars of mirror neurons and empathy as mediated through dance and D/MT. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The aim of this study was to evaluate the craniovertebral angle, head position angle, pain threshold of the sternocleidomastoid and upper trapezius muscles, and presence of depression in heavy smartphone users compared to a control group. Twenty healthy students participated in the study. The participants were recruited from Sahmyook University and were divided into a heavy user group (n=10) and a control group (n=10) according to smartphone addiction proneness. Participants in both groups were assessed for their pain pressure threshold of the sternocleidomastoid and upper trapezius muscles, craniovertebral angle and head position angle, and depression. When comparing the results between the two groups, there were significant differences in the pain threshold of the sternocleidomastoid and upper trapezius muscles, head position angle, and depression (p{\textless}.05), but not in the craniovertebral angle. Based on the results, this study shows that heavy smartphone use may produce considerable stresses on the cervical spine, thus changing the cervical curve and pain threshold of the muscles around the neck. Smartphones could also cause negative effects on a person's psychological status, such as depression. Therefore, individuals should make an effort to look at their phones with a neutral spine and to avoid spending hours hunched over their screens each day.},

In particular, the framework implements a trajectory generative module using a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based method and develops a human preference feedback system to enable the robot to learn human preferences. In addition, a convolutional neural network, acting as a discriminative network, classifies numeral images to support the development of the basic numeral writing ability, and another convolutional neural network, acting as a human preference network, learns a human user's aesthetic preference by taking the feedback on two written numerical images during the training process. The experimental results show that the written numerals based on the preferences of ten users were different from those of the training data set and that the writing models with the preferences from different users generate numerals in different styles, as evidenced by the Fr{\'{e}}chet inception distance (FID) scores. The FID scores of the proposed framework with a preference network were noticeably greater than those of the framework without a preference network. This phenomenon indicates that the human-machine interactions effectively guided the robotic system to learn different writing styles. These results prove that the proposed approach is able to enable the calligraphy robot to successfully write numerals in accordance with the preferences of a human user.},

abstract = {Responses of neurons in inferior temporal cortex during memory-guided visual search. J. Neurophysiol. 80: 2918-2940, 1998. A typical scene will contain many different objects, few of which are relevant to behavior at any given moment. Thus attentional mechanisms are needed to select relevant objects for visual processing and control over behavior. We examined this role of attention in the inferior temporal cortex of macaque monkeys, using a visual search paradigm. While the monkey maintained fixation, a cue stimulus was presented at the center of gaze, followed by a blank delay period. After the delay, an array of two to five choice stimuli was presented extrafoveally, and the monkey was rewarded for detecting a target stimulus matching the cue. The behavioral response was a saccadic eye movement to the target in one version of the task and a lever release in another. The array was composed of one "good" stimulus (effective in driving the cell when presented alone) and one or more "poor" stimuli (ineffective in driving the cell when presented alone). Most cells showed higher delay activity after a good stimulus used as the cue than after a poor stimulus. The baseline activity of cells was also higher preceding a good cue, if the animal expected it to occur. This activity may depend on a top-down bias in favor of cells coding the relevant stimulus. When the choice array was presented, most cells showed suppressive interactions between the stimuli as well as strong attention effects. When the choice array was presented in the contralateral visual field, most cells initially responded the same, regardless of which stimulus was the target. However, within 150-200 ms of array onset, responses were determined by the target stimulus. If the target was the good stimulus, the response to the array became equal to the response to the good stimulus presented alone. If the target was a poor stimulus, the response approached the response to that stimulus presented alone. Thus the influence of the nontarget stimulus was eliminated. These effects occurred well in advance of the behavioral response. When the array was positioned with stimuli on opposite sides of the vertical meridian, the contralateral stimulus appeared to dominate the response, and this dominant effect could not be overcome by attention. Overall, the results support a "biased competition" model of attention, according to which 1) objects in the visual field compete for representation in the cortex, and 2) this competition is biased in favor of the behaviorally relevant object by virtue of "top-down" feedback from structures involved in working memory.},

Because of the importance of communication in our activities of daily living, it is crucial to study methods to evaluate and provide the necessary feedback that can be used in order to improve these communication capabilities and, therefore, learn how to express ourselves better. In this work, we propose a system capable of evaluating quantitatively the quality of oral presentations in an automatic fashion. The system is based on a multi-modal RGB, depth, and audio data description and a fusion approach in order to recognize behavioral cues and train classifiers able to eventually predict communication quality levels. The performance of the proposed system is tested on a novel dataset containing Bachelor thesis' real defenses, presentations from an 8th semester Bachelor courses, and Master courses' presentations at Universitat de Barcelona. Using as groundtruth the marks assigned by actual instructors, our system achieves high performance categorizing and ranking presentations by their quality, and also making real-valued mark predictions.},

Our approach works by training a neural network to mimic the fitness function of a design optimization task and then, using the differential nature of the neural network, perform gradient decent to maximize the fitness. We demonstrate this methods effectiveness by designing an optimized heat sink and both 2D and 3D airfoils that maximize the lift drag ratio under steady state flow conditions. We highlight that our method has two distinct benefits over other automated design approaches. First, evaluating the neural networks prediction of fitness can be orders of magnitude faster then simulating the system of interest. Second, using gradient decent allows the design space to be searched much more efficiently then other gradient free methods. These two strengths work together to overcome some of the current shortcomings of automated design.},

For example, a threat to self via cognitive dissonance might be reduced by a favorable social comparison outcome. To explain substitution, it is suggested that self-esteem regulation mechanisms inevitably produce affect and that affect mediates the completion of various self-esteem regulation processes. Substitution can be understood in terms of the transfer of affect from the initial mechanism to the substitute mechanism. To be effective, this transfer must take place without awareness. Also discussed is the substitution of self-esteem regulation mechanisms across different self-domains versus within a single self-domain. Current theory suggests that substitution might be more effective within domain; that is, it is better to bolster the aspect of self that has been threatened. It is suggested here, however, that substitution across self-domain might be relatively resilient and easier to accomplish.},

@article{KhadjehNassirtoussi2015,
abstract = {In this paper a novel approach is proposed to predict intraday directional-movements of a currency-pair in the foreign exchange market based on the text of breaking financial news-headlines. The motivation behind this work is twofold: First, although market-prediction through text-mining is shown to be a promising area of work in the literature, the text-mining approaches utilized in it at this stage are not much beyond basic ones as it is still an emerging field. This work is an effort to put more emphasis on the text-mining methods and tackle some specific aspects thereof that are weak in previous works, namely: the problem of high dimensionality as well as the problem of ignoring sentiment and semantics in dealing with textual language. This research assumes that addressing these aspects of text-mining have an impact on the quality of the achieved results. The proposed system proves this assumption to be right. The second part of the motivation is to research a specific market, namely, the foreign exchange market, which seems not to have been researched in the previous works based on predictive text-mining. Therefore, results of this work also successfully demonstrate a predictive relationship between this specific market-type and the textual data of news. Besides the above two main components of the motivation, there are other specific aspects that make the setup of the proposed system and the conducted experiment unique, for example, the use of news article-headlines only and not news article-bodies, which enables usage of short pieces of text rather than long ones; or the use of general financial breaking news without any further filtration. In order to accomplish the above, this work produces a multi-layer algorithm that tackles each of the mentioned aspects of the text-mining problem at a designated layer. The first layer is termed the Semantic Abstraction Layer and addresses the problem of co-reference in text mining that is contributing to sparsity. Co-reference occurs when two or more words in a text corpus refer to the same concept. This work produces a custom approach by the name of Heuristic-Hypernyms Feature-Selection which creates a way to recognize words with the same parent-word to be regarded as one entity. As a result, prediction accuracy increases significantly at this layer which is attributed to appropriate noise-reduction from the feature-space. The second layer is termed Sentiment Integration Layer, which integrates sentiment analysis capability into the algorithm by proposing a sentiment weight by the name of SumScore that reflects investors' sentiment. Additionally, this layer reduces the dimensions by eliminating those that are of zero value in terms of sentiment and thereby improves prediction accuracy. The third layer encompasses a dynamic model creation algorithm, termed Synchronous Targeted Feature Reduction (STFR). It is suitable for the challenge at hand whereby the mining of a stream of text is concerned. It updates the models with the most recent information available and, more importantly, it ensures that the dimensions are reduced to the absolute minimum. The algorithm and each of its layers are extensively evaluated using real market data and news content across multiple years and have proven to be solid and superior to any other comparable solution. The proposed techniques implemented in the system, result in significantly high directional-accuracies of up to 83.33{\%}. On top of a well-rounded multifaceted algorithm, this work contributes a much needed research framework for this context with a test-bed of data that must make future research endeavors more convenient. The produced algorithm is scalable and its modular design allows improvement in each of its layers in future research. This paper provides ample details to reproduce the entire system and the conducted experiments. {\textcopyright}2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

For nonwords, priming dropped to the long-term value with a single intervening item. This Lag x Lexicality interaction was replicated with a naming task in Experiment 2 and with high-frequency words in Experiment 3. Word frequency affected long-term priming but not the size or decay rate of short-term priming, dissociating the two repetition effects.

SEM is a special elaboration of ordinary path analysis. It also involves a path diagram... However, SEM has several important advantages over the older path analysis method. One major advantage is that stSEM gives you an overall measure of the fit between the theory (as described by the path diagram) and the correlations among the scores in your sample, called a fit index. 
There are several fit indexes, but for most, a fit of 0.90 or higher is considered a good fit. A widely used fit index that works a little differently is RMSEA - the smaller the better... Fits below .05 are considered to be very good, below about 0.10, good.IN SEM you can also do a kind of significance test of the fit - (kind of because the null hypothesis is that the theory fits). Thus a significant result tells you that the theory does not fit. 
A second major advantage of SEM over ordinary path analysis is that it uses what are called latent variabliees.
p.641 some limitations of causal modeling
- alternative theories always possible
- other patterns of causality possible - correlation does not demonstrate direction of causality! ...if you haven't used random assignement to groups, the direction of cause and effect cannot be determined beyond a reasonable doubt.
- only linear relationships - if the underlying relationships are curvilinear, or if other limtations apply, such as restriction in range (distortion of results toward smaller path coefficients) , ...(SEM) are more likely to give misleading results than simple bivariate correlations.},

However, as is, this approach is not suitable for photorealistic style transfer. Even when both the input and reference images are photographs, the output still exhibits distortions reminiscent of a painting. Our contribution is to constrain the transformation from the input to the output to be locally affine in colorspace, and to express this constraint as a custom fully differentiable energy term. We show that this approach successfully suppresses distortion and yields satisfying photorealistic style transfers in a broad variety of scenarios, including transfer of the time of day, weather, season, and artistic edits.},

abstract = {None of the agile methods are claimed to fit all development situations. A team should attempt to adapt the methods and practices to fit their specific needs. For that reason agile principles call for self-reflection on a regular basis in order to identify where and how to make improvements. While some systematic approaches on how to execute this self-reflection process effectively have already been proposed, little empirical evidence currently exists. This paper reports empirical results based on a study where a project team conducted a self-reflection process called ldquopost-iteration workshoprdquo in order to improve and optimize the adopted practices in an XP project. Both qualitative and quantitative data were collected from four 1-2 hour workshops. The results show that with less than 4{\{}{\%}{\}} effort it is possible to hold post-iteration workshops that significantly help to improve and optimize practices and enhance the learning and satisfaction of the project team.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright}2016. Stock price forecasting is an important and thriving topic in financial engineering especially since new techniques and approaches on this matter are gaining ground constantly. In the contemporary era, the ceaseless use of social media has reached unprecedented levels, which has led to the belief that the expressed public sentiment could be correlated with the behavior of stock prices. The idea is to recognize patterns which confirm this correlation and use them to predict the future behavior of the various stock prices. With no doubt, though uninteresting individually, tweets can provide a satisfactory reection of public sentiment when taken in aggregate. In this paper, we develop a system which collects past tweets, processes them further, and examines the effectiveness of various machine learning techniques such as Naive Bayes Bernoulli classification and Support Vector Machine (SVM), for providing a positive or negative sentiment on the tweet corpus. Subsequently, we employ the same machine learning algorithms to analyze how tweets correlate with stock market price behavior. Finally, we examine our prediction's error by comparing our algorithm's outcome with next day's actual close price. Overall, the ultimate goal of this project is to forecast how the market will behave in the future via sentiment analysis on a set of tweets over the past few days, as well as to examine if the theory of contrarian investing is applicable. The final results seem to be promising as we found correlation between sentiment of tweets and stock prices.},

The respondents answered which character they anticipated to win in the final episode of the series, and explained their choice of the final candidate in free text from which sentiments were extracted. These sentiments were compared to feature sets derived from candidate likeability and candidate personality ratings. In our benchmarking of 10-fold cross-validation in 100 repetitions, all feature sets except the likeability ratings yielded a 10-11{\%} improvement in accuracy on the holdout set over the base model. Treating the class imbalance with synthetic minority oversampling (SMOTE) increased holdout set performance by 20-34{\%} but surprisingly not testing set performance. Taken together, our study provides a quantified estimation of the additional predictive value of psychological predictors. Likeability ratings were clearly outperformed by the feature sets based on personality, emotional valence, and basic emotions.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS Smartphone addiction, its association with smartphone use, and its predictors have not yet been studied in a European sample. This study investigated indicators of smartphone use, smartphone addiction, and their associations with demographic and health behaviour-related variables in young people. METHODS A convenience sample of 1,519 students from 127 Swiss vocational school classes participated in a survey assessing demographic and health-related characteristics as well as indicators of smartphone use and addiction. Smartphone addiction was assessed using a short version of the Smartphone Addiction Scale for Adolescents (SAS-SV). Logistic regression analyses were conducted to investigate demographic and health-related predictors of smartphone addiction. RESULTS Smartphone addiction occurred in 256 (16.9{\%}) of the 1,519 students. Longer duration of smartphone use on a typical day, a shorter time period until first smartphone use in the morning, and reporting that social networking was the most personally relevant smartphone function were associated with smartphone addiction. Smartphone addiction was more prevalent in younger adolescents (15-16 years) compared with young adults (19 years and older), students with both parents born outside Switzerland, persons reporting lower physical activity, and those reporting higher stress. Alcohol and tobacco consumption were unrelated to smartphone addiction. DISCUSSION Different indicators of smartphone use are associated with smartphone addiction and subgroups of young people have a higher prevalence of smartphone addiction. CONCLUSIONS The study provides the first insights into smartphone use, smartphone addiction, and predictors of smartphone addiction in young people from a European country, which should be extended in further studies.},

abstract = {Flexibility, despite its popularity, is not yet an academically mature concept ? compared with optimality and robustness, for example. Flexibility is nevertheless recognised as a critical attribute of a system, a process, or an organisation; it is needed in order to cope with uncertainty and change, and implies an ability to change and adapt to a range of conditions. An interesting observation has been made that the concept of flexibility is today where the notion of quality was some 20 years ago, ?vague and difficult to improve, yet critical to competitiveness?. In this paper, we review the concept of flexibility as discussed in a number of academic disciplines that have grappled with this concept, and highlight the major themes, challenges, and limitations in each case. We analyse flexibility in the context of decision theory, real options, manufacturing systems, and engineering design. We also provide a critical assessment of the use and abuse of the word flexibility in the technical literature. Finally, we propose a series of research questions that can help transform flexibility into a quantifiable engineering attribute and grow this concept to the level of maturity of optimisation and robustness in system design.},

Three objectives are distinguished, the avoidance of bias, the establishment of a secure base for the estimation of error in traditional designs, and the provision of formally exact tests of significance and confidence limits. The approximate randomization theory associated with analysis of covariance is outlined and conditionality considerations are used to explain the limited role of randomization in experiments with very small numbers of experimental units. The relation between the so-called design-based and model-based analyses is discussed. Corresponding results in sampling theory are mentioned briefly.},

... Campion and colleagues conducted two studies to examine factors that influence team effectiveness (Campion et al., 1993, 1996). 
Based on a broad review of the literature, they identified five sets of thematic team characteristics,which they assessed from 
individual team members and related directly to facets of team effectiveness.

The characteristics included 
job design (self-management, participation, task variety, task significance, task identity), 
team composition (heterogeneity, flexibility, relative size, preference for team work by members), 
contextual factors (training, managerial support, interteam communication and cooperation), 
task interdependence (task interdependence, goal interdependence, and interdependent feedback and rewards), and 
process (potency, social support, workload sharing, and intrateam communication and cooperation). 

With respect to Hackman's model and the perspective taken in this review, contextual factors and team composition serve as input conditions, job design and task interdependence as design factors, andprocessas,well,processes

abstract = {In the past, research on human–technology interaction has almost exclusively concentrated on aspects of usefulness and usability. Despite the success of this line of research, its narrow perspective has recently become a target for criticism. To explain why people prefer some systems over others, factors such as aesthetic qualities and emotional experiences play an important role in addition to instrumental aspects. In the following, we report three experiments that illustrate the importance of such factors. In the first experiment, we study the role of emotions in human–technology interaction by using Scherer's (1984) component theory of emotions as a theoretical foundation. A combination of methods is derived from that theory and employed to measure subjective feelings, motor expressions, physiological reactions, cognitive appraisals, and behaviour. The results demonstrate that the manipulation of selected system properties may lead to differences in usability that affect emotional user reactions. The second experiment investigates the interplay of instrumental and non-instrumental system qualities. The results show that users' overall appraisal of a technical device is influenced by both groups of qualities. In the third experiment, we join the approaches of the first two studies to analyse the influence of usability and aesthetics within a common design. The results indicate that systems differing in these aspects affect the perception of instrumental and non-instrumental qualities as well as the users' emotional experience and their overall appraisal of the system. Summarizing our results, we present a model specifying three central components of user experience and their interrelations (CUE-Model). The model integrates the most important aspects of human–technology interaction and hints at a number of interesting issues for future research.},

Key to developing such creative interactions are abstractions and grammars of action and other notions; the article explores the history of these in HCI and how they are to be used in the contemporary interaction and design space, in relation to AI. The article is programmatic rather than empirical though its argument uses real-world examples.},

To help with the search and recommendation of GIFs, we aim to predict their emotions perceived by humans based on their contents. Since previous solutions to this problem only utilize image-based features and lose all the motion informa- tion, we propose to use 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract spatiotemporal features from GIFs. We evaluate our methodology on a crowd-sourcing platform called GIFGIF with more than 6000 animated GIFs, and achieve a better accuracy then any previous approach in predicting crowd-sourced intensity scores of 17 emotions. It is also found that our trained model can be used to distinguish and cluster emotions in terms of valence and risk perception.},

abstract = {A substantial body of evidence collected by Batson and his associates has advanced the idea that pure (i.e., selfless) altruism occurs under conditions of empathy for a needy other. An egoistic alternative account of this evidence was proposed and tested in our work. We hypothesized that an observer's heightened empathy for a sufferer brings with it increased personal sadness in the observer and that it is the egoistic desire to relieve the sadness, rather than the selfless desire to relieve the sufferer, that motivates helping. Two experiments contrasted predictions from the selfless and egoistic alternatives in the paradigm typically used by Batson and his associates. In the first, an empathic orientation to a victim increased personal sadness, as expected. Furthermore, when sadness and empathic emotion were separated experimentally, helping was predicted by the levels of sadness subjects were experiencing but not by their empathy scores. In the second experiment, enhanced sadness was again associated with empathy for a victim. However, subjects who were led to perceive that their moods could not be altered through helping (because of the temporary action of a "mood-fixing" placebo drug) were not helpful, despite high levels of empathic emotion. The results were interpreted as providing support for an egoistically based interpretation of helping under conditions of high empathy. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2010 APA, all rights reserved)},

When programming teams buy into TDD, they immediately see positive results. They eliminate the fear involved in their jobs, and are better equipped to tackle the difficult challenges that face them. TDD eliminates tentative traits, it teaches programmers to communicate, and it encourages team members to seek out criticism However, even the author admits that grumpiness must be worked out individually! In short, the premise behind TDD is that code should be continually tested and refactored.

abstract = {Lack of user acceptance has long been an impediment to the success of new information systems. The present research addresses why users accept or reject information systems and how user acceptance is affected by system design features. The technology acceptance model (TAM) specifies the causal relationships between system design features, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, attitude toward using, and actual usage behavior. Attitude theory from psychology provides the rationale for hypothesized model relationships, and validated measures were used to operationalize model variables. A field study of 112 users regarding two end-user systems was conducted to test the hypothesized model. TAM fully mediated the effects of system characteristics on usage behavior, accounting for 36{\%} of the variance in usage. Perhaps the most striking finding was that perceived usefulness was 50{\%} more influential than ease of use in determining usage, underscoring the importance of incorporating the appropriate functional capabilities in new systems. Overall, TAM provides an informative representation of the mechanisms by which design choices influence user acceptance, and should therefore be helpful in applied contexts for forecasting and evaluating user acceptance of information technology. Implications for future research and practice are discussed.},

abstract = {The work concerns the problem of reducing a pre-trained deep neuronal network to a smaller network, with just few layers, whilst retaining the network's functionality on a given task. In this particular case study, we are focusing on the networks developed for the purposes of face recognition. The proposed approach is motivated by the observation that the aim to deliver the highest accuracy possible in the broadest range of operational conditions, which many deep neural networks models strive to achieve, may not necessarily be always needed, desired or even achievable due to the lack of data or technical constraints. In relation to the face recognition problem, we formulated an example of such a use case, the ‘backyard dog' problem. The ‘backyard dog', implemented by a lean network, should correctly identify members from a limited group of individuals, a ‘family', and should distinguish between them. At the same time, the network must produce an alarm to an image of an individual who is not in a member of the family, i.e. a ‘stranger'. To produce such a lean network, we propose a network shallowing algorithm. The algorithm takes an existing deep learning model on its input and outputs a shallowed version of the model. The algorithm is non-iterative and is based on the advanced supervised principal component analysis. Performance of the algorithm is assessed in exhaustive numerical experiments. Our experiments revealed that in the above use case, the ‘backyard dog' problem, the method is capable of drastically reducing the depth of deep learning neural networks, albeit at the cost of mild performance deterioration. In this work, we proposed a simple non-iterative method for shallowing down pre-trained deep convolutional networks. The method is generic in the sense that it applies to a broad class of feed-forward networks, and is based on the advanced supervise principal component analysis. The method enables generation of families of smaller-size shallower specialized networks tuned for specific operational conditions and tasks from a single larger and more universal legacy network.},

It has repeatedly been argued that perception of control is not only desirable, but is also probably a psychological and biological necessity. In this article, we review the literature supporting this claim and present evidence of a biological basis for the need for control and for choice-that is, the means by which we exercise control over the environment. Converging evidence from animal research, clinical studies and neuroimaging suggests that the need for control is a biological imperative for survival, and a corticostriatal network is implicated as the neural substrate of this adaptive behavior. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

The paper points to a variety of factors that will need to be studied and understood in detail in order to build such systems. It examines selected technical literature about creativity to determine what key characteristics have been proposed as underlying creative production. In addition, as the existence of creativity is a judgment relative to personal or group norms, it is helpful to understand what factors inform that judgment. Besemer's creative product semantic scale for product assessment provides three dimensions, with nine attributes that can be used for judgments. This paper discusses how creative product assessment scales might provide important clues about how to build computational systems in order to produce creative products.},

This sensation is widely reported to be accompanied by feelings of relaxation and well-being. The current study identifies several common triggers used to achieve ASMR, including whispering, personal attention, crisp sounds and slow movements. Data obtained also illustrates temporary improvements in symptoms of depression and chronic pain in those who engage in ASMR. A high prevalence of synaesthesia (5.9{\%}) within the sample suggests a possible link between ASMR and synaesthesia, similar to that of misophonia. Links between number of effective triggers and heightened flow state suggest that flow may be necessary to achieve sensations associated with ASMR.},

abstract = {Cultural considerations in social anxiety are a rarely investigated topic although it seems likely that differences between countries in social norms may relate to the extent of social anxiety. The present study investigated individuals' personal and perceived cultural norms and their relation to social anxiety and fear of blushing. A total of 909 participants from eight countries completed vignettes describing social situations and evaluated the social acceptability of the behavior of the main actor both from their own, personal perspective as well as from a cultural viewpoint. Personal and cultural norms showed somewhat different patterns in comparison between types of countries (individualistic/collectivistic). According to reported cultural norms, collectivistic countries were more accepting toward socially reticent and withdrawn behaviors than was the case in individualistic countries. In contrast, there was no difference between individualistic and collectivistic countries on individuals' personal perspectives regarding socially withdrawn behavior. Collectivistic countries also reported greater levels of social anxiety and more fear of blushing than individualistic countries. Significant positive relations occurred between the extent to which attention-avoiding behaviors are accepted in a culture and the level of social anxiety or fear of blushing symptoms. These results provide initial evidence that social anxiety may be related to different cultural norms across countries. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Drawing from the Transaction-Based Model of stress and prior research on the effects of ICTs on end users, we first conceptually build a nomological net for technostress to understand the influence of technostress on three variables relating to end users of ICTs: job satisfaction, and organizational and continuance commitment. Because there are no prior instruments to measure constructs related to technostress, we develop and empirically validate two second order constructs: technostress creators (i.e., factors that create stress from the use of ICTs) and technostress inhibitors (i.e., organizational mechanisms that reduce stress from the use of ICTs). We test our conceptual model using data from the responses of 608 end users of ICTs from multiple organizations to a survey questionnaire. Our results, based on structural equation modeling (SEM), show that technostress creators decrease job satisfaction, leading to decreased organizational and continuance commitment, while Technostress inhibitors increase job satisfaction and organizational and continuance commitment. We also find that age, gender, education, and computer confidence influence technostress. The implications of these results and future research directions are discussed.},

abstract = {Teams of people working together for a common purpose have been a centerpiece of human social organization ever since our ancient ancestors first banded together to hunt game, raise families, and defend their communities. Human history is largely a story of people working together in groups to explore, achieve, and conquer. Yet, the modern concept of work in large organizations that developed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries is largely a tale of work as a collection of individual jobs. A variety of global forces unfolding over the last two decades, however, has pushed organizations worldwide to restructure work around teams, to enable more rapid, flexible, and adaptive responses to the unexpected. This shift in the structure of work has made team effectiveness a salient organizational concern. Teams touch our lives everyday and their effectiveness is important to well-being across a wide range of societal functions. There is over 50 years of psychological research-literally thousands of studies-focused on understanding and influencing the processes that underlie team effectiveness. Our goal in this monograph is to sift through this voluminous literature to identify what we know, what we think we know, and what we need to know to improve the effectiveness of work groups and teams. We begin by defining team effectiveness and establishing the conceptual underpinnings of our approach to understanding it. We then turn to our review, which concentrates primarily on topics that have well-developed theoretical and empirical foundations, to ensure that our conclusions and recommendations are on firm footing. Our review begins by focusing on cognitive, motivational/affective, and behavioral team processes-processes that enable team members to combine their resources to resolve task demands and, in so doing, be effective. We then turn our attention to identifying interventions, or "levers," that can shape or align team processes and thereby provide tools and applications that can improve team effectiveness. Topic-specific conclusions and recommendations are given throughout the review. There is a solid foundation for concluding that there is an emerging science of team effectiveness and that findings from this research foundation provide several means to improve team effectiveness. In the concluding section, we summarize our primary findings to highlight specific research, application, and policy recommendations for enhancing the effectiveness of work groups and teams.},

abstract = {A field experiment conducted with 53 hard-rock miners in an underground
metal mine examined the effects of two interventions, team
building and goal setting, on miners' productivity and strategy development.
The study employed a 2 x 2 factorial design with random assignment
of participants to the goal setting condition, and it used objective
criteria of performance. Unfortunately, the results were inconclusive.
Although slight improvements occurred in some measures of performance
and strategy development, it is not clear that these improvements
were results of the interventions. More of these improvements
occurred in the goal setting than in the team building condition. Limitations
in the research design and factors in the experimental setting that
could not be controlled led to equivocality of these results.},
annote = {Note5:
- experiment

Previous research
on goal setting has been conducted primarily in laboratories under controlled
conditions. Those field experiments that have been conducted have
generally had nonunionized participants performing relatively simple, routine
tasks. As others have pointed out, problems may arise in applying goal
setting in situations in which tasks are complex, unstructured, or interdependent
(Baumler, 1971; Latham {\{}{\&}{\}}amp; Yukl, 1975; Locke {\{}{\&}{\}}amp; Latham, 1984). The
present study suggests that the effects of goal setting on performance: may be
muted under such conditions.
========
The importance of goal setting for motivating employees' performance
was first explicitly recognized in the management literature by Taylor (1911);
Locke (1968) translated the concept into a contemporary theory of task
performance. According to Locke's theory, if workers accept hard, specific
goals, performance improves. In the most thorough review of goal setting
to date, Locke, Shaw, Saari, and Latham (1981) viewed goal setting as primarily
a motivational phenomenon, but acknowledged that it also involves cognitive
elements. From a motivational standpoint, goal setting affects the
direction, amplitude (effort), and duration (persistence) of action, From a
cognitive perspective, goal setting is thought to affect strategy development
or ways to accomplish goals. The first three of these mechanisms are relatively
direct in their effects on performance. Strategy development is more
indirect. Locke and colleagues (1981) noted that this concept
involves developing strategies or action plans for attaining one's
goals. Although strategy development is motivated by goals, the
mechanism itself is cognitive in essence; it involves skill development
or creative problem solving (1981: 132).},

abstract = {In the winter of 2000, at the height of the dot-com boom, business leaders posed for the covers of "Time," "BusinessWeek," and the "Economist" with the aplomb and confidence of rock stars. These were a different breed from their counterparts of just ten or 20 years before, who shunned the press and whose comments were carefully crafted by corporate PR departments. Such love of the limelight often stems from what Freud called a narcissistic personality, says psychoanalyst and anthropologist Michael Maccoby in this HBR classic first published in the January-February 2000 issue. Narcissists are good for companies in extraordinary times, those that need people with the passion and daring to take them in new directions. But narcissists can also lead companies into disaster by refusing to listen to the advice and warnings of their managers. It's not always true, as Andy Grove famously put it, that only the paranoid survive. Most business advice is focused on the more analytic personality that Freud labeled obsessive. But recommendations about creating teamwork and being more receptive to subordinates will not resonate with narcissists. They didn't get where they are by listening to others, so why should they listen to anyone when they're at the top of their game? Narcissists who want to overcome the limits of their personalities must work as hard at that as they do at business success. One solution is to find a trusted sidekick, who can point out the operational requirements of the narcissistic leader's often overly grandiose vision and keep him rooted in reality. Another is to take a leap of faith and go into psychoanalysis, which can give these leaders the tools to overcome their sometimes fatal character flaws.},

organizational learningdouble-loop learningconcept

It is widely agreed that learning consists of two kinds of activity. The first kind of learning is obtaining know-how in order to solve specific problems based upon existing premises. The second kind of learning is establishing new premises (i.e., paradigms, schemata, mental models, or perspectives) to override the existing ones. These two kinds of learning have been referred to as {\{}{\&}{\}}quot;Learning I{\{}{\&}{\}}quot; and {\{}{\&}{\}}quot;Learning II{\{}{\&}{\}}quot; (Bateson, 1973) or {\{}{\&}{\}}quot;single-loop learning{\{}{\&}{\}}quot; and {\{}{\&}{\}}quot;double-loop learning{\{}{\&}{\}}quot; (Argyris and Sch{\{}{\{}{\"{o}}{\}}{\}}n, 1978). [...] Following the development of Argyris and Sch{\{}{\{}{\"{o}}{\}}{\}}n's (1978) theory of organizational learning, it has been widely assumed implicitly or explicitly that double-loop learning - the questioning and rebuilding of existing perspectives, interpretation frameworks, or decision premises - can be very difficult for organizations to implement by themselves. In order to overcome this difficulty, the learning theorists argue that some kind of artificial intervention, such as the use of an organizational development program, is required. The limitation of this argument is that it assumes that someone inside or outside an organization {\{}{\&}{\}}quot;objectively{\{}{\&}{\}}quot; knows the right time and method for putting double-loop learning into practice.},

abstract = {In a wide variety of settings, organizations generate a number of possible solutions to a problem-ideas-and then select a few for further development. We examine the effectiveness of two group structures for such tasks-the team structure, in which the group works together in time and space, and the hybrid structure, in which individuals first work independently and then work together. We define the performance of a group as the quality of the best ideas identified. Prior research has defined performance as the average quality of ideas or the number of ideas generated, ignoring what most organizations seek, a few great ideas. We build a theory that relates organizational phenomena to four different variables that govern the quality of the best ideas identified: (1) the average quality of ideas generated, (2) the number of ideas generated, (3) the variance in the quality of ideas generated, and (4) the ability of the group to discern the quality of the ideas. We test this theory with an experiment. We find that groups organized in the hybrid structure are able to generate more ideas, to generate better ideas, and to better discern the quality of the ideas they generate. Moreover, we find that the frequently recommended brainstorming technique of building on others' ideas is counterproductive; teams exhibiting such buildup neither create more ideas, nor are the ideas that build on previous ideas better.},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA.

This material is then used to contrast expert design reasoning with salient features of some popular characterizations of design thinking.

Autonomy is typically defined as {\{}{\&}{\}}quot;the degree to which
the task provides substantial freedom, independence, and discretion in
scheduling the work and in determining the procedures to be used in
carrying it out{\{}{\&}{\}}quot; (Hackman {\{}{\&}{\}}amp; Oldham, 1980, p. 79). Individual autonomy
refers to freedom, independence, and discretion in the individual task
(Hackman {\{}{\&}{\}}amp; Oldham, 1975, 1980; Karasek, 1998), while team autonomy
refers to the same attributes in the task of a team (Cordery, Mueller, {\{}{\&}{\}}amp;
Smith, 1991; Hackman, 1987; Kirkman {\{}{\&}{\}}amp; Rosen, 1999; Langfred, 2000).


================


The concept of ??team-member exchange?? (TMX; Cole et al., 2002; Seers
et al., 1995) can shed light on the role of co-worker support. TMX and
LMX are considered to be similar constructs (Cole et al., 2002; Seers et al.,
1995).

a{\{}{\_}{\}}autonomy (done)
Perceived team task autonomy. This was measured with an adapted
version of the individual task autonomy scale. The ??you?? in the original
items was replaced with ??your team?? in the team items, for example

Can your team influence its work pace?
We consider team task autonomy a team-level construct. We therefore averaged the individual scores at the
team level.},

abstract = {Much of psychology focuses on universal principles of thought and action. Although an extremely productive pursuit, this approach, by describing only the "average person," risks describing no one in particular. This article discusses an alternate approach that complements interests in universal principles with analyses of the unique psychological meaning that individuals find in their experiences and interactions. Rooted in research on social cognition, this approach examines how people's lay theories about the stability or malleability of human attributes alter the meaning they give to basic psychological processes such as self-regulation and social perception. Following a review of research on this lay theories perspective in the field of social psychology, the implications of analyzing psychological meaning for other fields such as developmental, cultural, and personality psychology are discussed.},

abstract = {Can we better understand modern consumer behavior by examining its links to our ancestral past? We consider the underlying motives for consumption and choice from an evolutionary perspective. We review evidence that deep-seated evolutionary motives continue to influence much modern behavior, albeit not always in obvious or conscious ways. These fundamental motives include: (1) evading physical harm, (2) avoiding disease, (3) making friends, (4) attaining status, (5) acquiring a mate, (6) keeping a mate, and (7) caring for family. We discuss how, why, and when these motives influence behavior, highlighting that many consumer choices ultimately function to help fulfill one or more of these evolutionary needs. An important implication of this framework is that a person's preferences, behaviors, and decision processes change in predictable ways depending on which fundamental motive is currently active. We discuss how consideration of evolutionary motives provides fertile ground for future consumer research, while also helping build bridges between consumer behavior, evolutionary biology, and other social sciences. {\textcopyright} 2013 Society for Consumer Psychology.},

abstract = {Training classifiers with datasets which suffer of imbalanced class distributions is an important problem in data mining. This issue occurs when the number of examples representing the class of interest is much lower than the ones of the other classes. Its presence in many real-world applications has brought along a growth of attention from researchers. We shortly review the many issues in machine learning and applications of this problem, by introducing the characteristics of the imbalanced dataset scenario in classification, presenting the specific metrics for evaluating performance in class imbalanced learning and enumerating the proposed solutions. In particular, we will describe preprocessing, cost-sensitive learning and ensemble techniques, carrying out an experimental study to contrast these approaches in an intra and inter-family comparison. We will carry out a thorough discussion on the main issues related to using data intrinsic characteristics in this classification problem. This will help to improve the current models with respect to: the presence of small disjuncts, the lack of density in the training data, the overlapping between classes, the identification of noisy data, the significance of the borderline instances, and the dataset shift between the training and the test distributions. Finally, we introduce several approaches and recommendations to address these problems in conjunction with imbalanced data, and we will show some experimental examples on the behavior of the learning algorithms on data with such intrinsic characteristics. {\textcopyright}2013 Elsevier Inc.

In addition, we consider theory and research that incorporates attributional therapy as one element of a broader approach to treatment (e.g., Beck, Rush, Shaw, {\&} Emery, 1979). For each approach, we first discuss the the- oretical framework from which the approach was derived and then review the empirical work in that area. In addition, we examine attribution ther- apy as it pertains to a variety of behavioral problems and disorders (e.g., insomnia, depression, and marital conflict). Throughout, we discuss limi- tations with current research and implications for future research on attri- butional approaches to cognitive and behavioral therapy. Preparation},

Successful implementation of this metacognitively guided strategy enhances learning. The necessary components are, first, that the metacognitions be accurate, and second, that the appropriate choices are implemented for study.

By defining the probability measure on a set of the studied combinatorial objects various numerical characteristics of these objects can be considered as random variables and studied using the methods of probability theory. The advantage of this approach is the well-developed probabilistic analytic techniques that allow us in many cases to obtain results, the proof of which by other methods appears too complicated, if indeed it is at all possible. The application of probabilistic methods is connected with extensive use of the terminology of probability theory. The reader will easily understand however that one speaks in fact about solving enumerative problems of discrete analysis. One of the primary research lines is the study of the limit properties of combinatorial objects manifested at the unlimited increase of the number of elements comprising such objects. It is often possible to represent the distributions of the characteristics of combinatorial objects as conditional distributions of the sums of independent random variables so that they can be studied using asymptotic methods in probability theory, namely limit theorems for sums of independent random variables.},

abstract = {Decision-making is often viewed as a two-stage process, where subjective values are first assigned to each option and then the option of the highest value is selected. Converging evidence suggests that these subjective values are represented in the striatum and medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC). A separate line of evidence suggests that activation in the same areas represents the values of rewards even when choice is not required, as in classical conditioning tasks. However, it is unclear whether the same neural mechanism is engaged in both cases. To address this question we measured brain activation with functional magnetic resonance imaging while human subjects passively viewed individual consumer goods. We then sampled activation from predefined regions of interest and used it to predict subsequent choices between the same items made outside of the scanner. Our results show that activation in the striatum and MPFC in the absence of choice predicts subsequent choices, suggesting that these brain areas represent value in a similar manner whether or not choice is required.},

abstract = {Abstract Problematic smartphone use is an emerging issue in behavioral addiction research. At the same time, measuring smartphone use with mobile apps has become increasingly common. However, understanding how much data are necessary requires careful consideration if the field is to move forward. Here, we examine how much time should be spent measuring mobile phone operation to reliably infer general patterns of usage and repetitive checking behaviors. In a second analysis, we consider whether a self-report measure of problematic smartphone use is associated with real-time patterns of use. Results suggest that smartphone usage collected for a minimum of 5 days will reflect typical weekly usage (in hours), but habitual checking behaviors (uses lasting {\textless}15 seconds) can be reliably inferred within 2 days. These measurements did not reliably correlate with a self-reported measure. We conclude that patterns of smartphone use are repetitive and our results suggest that checking behavior is a particularly consis...},

The items on the scale were sorted into three factors: tolerant, eventempered disposition; ascendant, sociable interpersonal style; and humanistic sociopolitical attitudes.

Factor analysis of Hogan's Empathy Scale, scored in Likert format, yielded four factors: Social Self-Confidence, Even Temperedness, Sensitivity, and Nonconformity. Correlations with 16 different personality measures and a set of 12 adjective rating scales confirmed the factors' unique psychological meanings. Empathy subscales, created from items loading primarily on one factor, accounted for roughly equal amounts of variance in Hogan's original Q-set empathy criterion, although the Sensitivity and Nonconformity factors appeared to be slightly more important.

Beginning in the 20s, a continuous, regular decline occurs for processing-intensive tasks (e.g., speed of processing, working memory, and long-term memory), whereas verbal knowledge increases across the life span. There is little differentiation in the cognitive architecture of memory across the life span. Visuospatial and verbal working memory are distinct but highly interrelated systems with domain-specific short-term memory subsystems. In contrast to recent neuroimaging data, there is little evidence for dedifferentiation of function at the behavioral level in old compared with young adults.

When self-regulation works well, it enables people to alter their behavior so as to conform to rules, plans, promises, ideals, and other standards. When it fails, any one of a broad range of human problems and misfortunes can arise. Self-regulation is thus a key to success in human life and, when it falls short, a contributing cause that helps explain many forms of human suffering. In this chapter, we provide an overview of the psychology of self-regulation. We shall review what it is, its importance, how it functions, how it fits into the broader context of human psychological functioning, and what some of its principal applications are.},

abstract = {In measuring positive psychological constructs, Likert-based response formats may introduce an acquiescence bias. To reduce this, items usually are transformed into negations of the concept. Such transformations may introduce errors, as negations of positive constructs may appear contra-intuitive. A semantic differential response format may be an alternative to negations for reducing the acquiescence bias. A drawback with this format is the increased cognitive demand, hence introducing new errors in scores. Using a scale measuring resilience as an example of a positive psychological construct, this study compared a Likert and a Semantic differential response format with respect to psychometric properties. Both formats were completed by 334 university students. Apart from slightly reduced variance and internal consistency, the factor structure in the semantic differential version fitted the data better, indicating better properties in terms of uni-dimensional loading items. Systematic error variance related to negative and positive differentials was minor (3.9{\%}). In conclusion, in measuring positive psychological constructs, a semantic differential format may effectively reduce acquiescence bias without lowering psychometric quality. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Recent event-related brain potential (ERP) study disentangled an early automatic component and a late top-down controlled component of neural activities to perceived pain of others. This study assessed the hypothesis that perspective taking modulates the top-down controlled component but not the automatic component of empathy for pain by recording ERPs from 24 subjects who performed pain judgments of pictures of hands in painful or non-painful situations from either self-perspective or other-perspective. We found that, relative to non-painful stimuli, painful stimuli induced positive shifts of ERPs at frontal-central electrodes as early as 160 ms after sensory stimulation and this effect lasted until 700 ms. The amplitudes of ERPs at 230-250 ms elicited by painful stimuli negatively correlated with both subjective ratings of others' pain and self-unpleasantness in both self-perspective and other-perspective conditions. Neural response to perceived pain over the central-parietal area was significantly reduced at 370-420 ms when performing the pain judgment task from other-perspective compared to self-perspective. The results suggest that shifting between self-perspectives and other-perspectives modulates the late controlled component but not the early automatic component of neural responses to perceived pain. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract = {Most psychological research on Brexit categorises participants as either leave or remain supporters. In the current study we take a data-driven approach and identify different clusterings of attitudes towards the European Union (EU) using latent class analysis (LCA), as well as how these classes differ across a range of important social and psychological variables. This analysis revealed 10 distinct classes of voters in a large (N = 15860) adult sample of UK citizens using data from the British Election Study. These classes ranged from being quite uniformly pro- or anti-EU in sentiment, to more mixed groups with more complex patterns of attitudes. The classes that included majority-remain supporters were younger and better educated, and self-rated more highly on the measures of actively open-minded thinking, openness, political trust, and external locus of control. The classes that included majority-leave supporters were older and less well educated, and self-rated more highly on the measures of authoritarianism and conscientiousness. However, there were also notable demographic and psychological differences within the classes associated with leavers and remainers. A full consideration of these attitudinal nuances will be necessary to achieve a deeper understanding of why the UK decided to leave the EU.},

Aims: We report a proposed diagnostic criteria and the designing of a mobile application (App) to identify smartphone addiction. Method: We used a novel empirical mode decomposition (EMD) to delineate the trend in smartphone use over one month. Results: The daily use count and the trend of this frequency are associated with smartphone addiction. We quantify excessive use by daily use duration and frequency, as well as the relationship between the tolerance symptoms and the trend for the median duration of a use epoch. The psychiatrists' assisted self-reporting use time is significant lower than and the recorded total smartphone use time via the App and the degree of underestimation was positively correlated with actual smartphone use. Conclusions: Our study suggests the identification of smartphone addiction by diagnostic interview and via the App-generated parameters with EMD analysis.},

abstract = {The term modern is typically associated with form, material and style in reference to products and industrial design. Modernity though has a century of use behind it in reference to design, and longer if one considers aesthetics, art, literature and the enduring legacy of the Enlightenment. Within this historical context there are considerable ambiguities and complexities associated aesthetically with the term. Today modernity, as seen in the advancement of technology, maintains a dominant yet strange presence. Given sophisticated yet convenient technology, blurred cultural distinctions and a chronic state of change, modernity is certainly open to questioning. Yet, within this swirling milieu can one approach the question of modernity (and postmodernism) in a fresh way? This paper seeks to explore attributes of design thinking as a means to further an overall discussion on modernity itself, as a continuing project, and inclusive of its pluralistic postmodernist face.},

abstract = {Empathy is critical for social functioning, but it often wanes when it is needed most. Resulting empathic failures precipitate and worsen social conflict. Accordingly, conflict-reduction interventions prioritize developing empathy in order to achieve harmony. Recent research has indicated that such interventions can benefit from a more nuanced understanding of empathy. First, empathy is a multidimensional construct, including understanding, sharing, and feeling concern for others' emotions. The expression of these empathic processes is further influenced by psychological factors that “tune” people toward or away from empathy. Interventions must therefore diagnose the specific nature and precursors of empathic failures and tailor interventions appropriately. Second, empathy alone may be insufficient to produce prosocial behavior, especially when parties differ in status or power. In these cases, interventions should promote equitable goals and norms in addition to empathy. By understanding its component processes and boundary conditions, practitioners can work to promote empathy in maximally effective ways.},

The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether and how goal orientation and self-consciousness are associated to tendencies of athletes to experience withdrawal thoughts. Method. The sample consisted of 71 volleyball players who took part in the finals of the British Universities Sport Association league. Three instruments were used: The Thought Occurrence Questionnaire for Sport, the Task and Ego Orientation in Sport Questionnaire, and the Self-Consciousness Scale. Results. Structural models revealed that task orientation was negatively related to thoughts of escape irrespective of game result (winning or losing), whereas ego orientation in a losing situation was positively related to experiencing such thoughts due to the self-focusing tendencies associated with an ego orientation. Conclusion. The present results support previous findings suggesting that high task compared to low task orientations are associated with greater cognitive stability. Furthermore, it is identified that within ego orientations factors outside the control of individuals, such as normatively based criteria, may play an important role in the cognitive processes of individuals. Finally, attention is drawn to the role of self-consciousness which seems important in explaining dysfunctional cognition experienced within an ego orientation. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {Members are skilled in all the various leadership and membership roles and functions required for interaction between leaders and members and between members and other members.
The group has been in existence sufficiently long to have developed well-established, relaxed working relationship among all its members.
The members of the group are attracted to it and are loyal to its members, including the leader.
The members and leaders have a high degree of confidence and trust in each other.
The values and goals of the group are a satisfactory integration and expression of the relevant values and needs of its members. They have helped shape these values and goals and are satisfied with them.
Insofar as members of the group are performing linking functions, they endeavor to have the values and goals of the groups which they link in harmony, one with the other.
The more important a value seems to the group, the greater the likelihood that the individual member will accept it.
The members of the group are highly motivated to abide by the major values and to achieve the important goals of the group. Each member will do all that he or she reasonably can--and at times all in his or her power--to help the group achieve its central objectives. Each member expects every other member to do the same.
All the interaction, problem-solving, decision-making activities of the group occur in a supportive atmosphere. Suggestions, comments, ideas, information, criticisms are all offered with a helpful orientation. Similarly, these contributions are received in the same spirit. Respect is shown for the point of view of others both in the way contributions are made and in the way they are received.
The superior of each work group exerts a major influence in establishing the tone and atmosphere of that work group by his or her leadership principles and practices. In the highly effective group, consequently, the leader adheres to those principles of leadership which create a supportive atmosphere in the group and a cooperative rather than a competitive relationship among the members.
The group is eager to help each member develop to his or her full potential. It sees, for example, that relevant technical knowledge and training in interpersonal and group skills are made available to each member.
Each member accepts willingly and without resentment the goals and expectations that the individual and the group establish for themselves. The anxieties, fears, and emotional stresses produced by direct pressure for high performance from a boss in a hierarchical situation are not present. Groups seem capable of setting high performance goals for the group as a whole and for each member. These goals are high enough to stimulate each member to do his or her best, but not so high as to create anxieties or fear of failure. In an effective group, each person can exert sufficient influence on the decisions of the group to prevent the group from setting unattainable goals for any member while setting high goals for all. The goals are adapted to the member=s capacity to perform.
The leader and the members believe that each group member can accomplish the Aimpossible. These expectations stretch each member to the maximum and accelerate personal growth. When necessary, the group tempers the expectation level so that the member is not broken by a feeling of failure or rejection.
When necessary or advisable, other members of the group will give a member the help needed to accomplish successfully the goals set for that person. Mutual help is a characteristic of highly effective groups.
The supportive atmosphere of the highly effective group stimulates creativity. The group does not demand narrow confirmation as do the work groups under authoritarian leaders. NO one has to Ayes the boss,@ nor is a person rewarded for such an attempt. The group attaches high value to new, creative approaches and solutions to its problems and to the problems of the organization of which it is a part.
The group knows the value of "constructive" conformity and knows when to use it and for what purposes. Although it does not permit conformity to affect adversely the creative efforts of its members, it does expect conformity on mechanical and administrative matters to save the time of members and to facilitate the group's activities.
There is strong motivation on the part of each member to communicate fully and frankly to the group all the information which is relevant and of value to the group's activity.
There is high motivation in the group to use the communication process so that it best serves the interests and goals of the group. Every item which a member feels is important, but which for some reason is being ignored, will be repeated until it receives the attention that it deserves. Members strive also to avoid communicating unimportant information so as not to waste the group's time.
Just as there is high motivation to communicate, there is correspondingly strong motivation to receive communications. Each member is genuinely interested in any information on any relevant matter that any member of the group can provide. This information is welcomed and trusted as being honestly and sincerely given. Members do not look "behind" information and attempt to interpret it in ways opposite to its purported intent.
In the highly effective group, there are strong motivations to try to influence other members as well as to be receptive to influence by them. This applies to all the group's activities: technical matters, methods, organizational problems, interpersonal relationships, and group processes.
The group efforts of the highly effective group enable the members to exert more influence on the leader and to communicate far more information to him or her, including suggestions as to what needs to be done and how the leader could do a better job, than is possible in one-to-one relationship. By "tossing the ball" back and forth among the members, a group can communicate information to the leader which no single person on a one-to-one basis dare do.
The ability of the members of a group to influence each other contributes to the flexibility and adaptability of the group. Ideas, goals, and attitudes do not become frozen if members are able to influence each other continuously.
In the highly effective group, individual members feel secure in making decisions which seem appropriate to them because the goals and philosophy of operation are clearly understood by each member and provide a solid base for making decisions. This unleashes initiative and pushes decisions down while still maintaining a coordinated and directed effort.
The leader of a highly effective group is selected carefully. His or her leadership ability is so evident that he or she would probably emerge as a leader in any unstructured situation. To increase the likelihood that persons of high leadership competence are selected, the organization is likely to use peer nominations and related methods in selecting group leaders.},

Our answer at this point is that outside of the realm of sports,
there is insufficient evidence to know for certain

It is also critical that the research questions
posed and predictions expected correspond not only with the

these types of considerations, the examination of any theory or

Festinger and colleagues (1950) referred to the field of forces

suggested that cohesion is better conceived as the resistance of the
group to disruption.

There is a substantial amount of disparate research and the proposed mechanistic explanation meaningfully integrates this body of brain and behavioral data into a single, unified model. The model's central feature is a cascading, two-step process. First, exercise engages arousal mechanisms in the reticular-activating system. This activation process, which involves a number of neurotransmitter systems, has several interrelated effects on cognition and emotion but, in general, has evolved to facilitate implicit information processing. Second, exercise disengages the higher-order functions of the prefrontal cortex. This deactivation process, which is caused in part by resource limitations, also has several interrelated effects but, in general, has evolved to keep the inefficient explicit system and unhelpful emotional processes from compromising the implicit system's functioning when optimal motor execution is needed most.

In a controlled trial 33 commuters were randomly divided between three conditions: Mobile narratives (MN); New age music and videos (NA); no treatment (CT). In two consecutive days the MN and NA samples experienced during their commute trip 2 x 2 6-minute multimedia experiences on a Motorola A925 3G phone provided by the "TRE" Italian UMTS carrier: the MN sample experienced a mobile narrative based on the exploration of a desert beach; the NA sample experienced a commercial new age video with similar visual contents. The trials showed the efficacy of mobile narratives in reducing the level of stress experienced during a commute trip. No effects were found in the other groups. These results suggest that 3G mobile handsets may be used as relaxation tool if backed by a specific therapeutic protocol and meaningful narratives.},

abstract = {There has been a recent resurgence in the area of explainable artificial intelligence as researchers and practitioners seek to provide more transparency to their algorithms. Much of this research is focused on explicitly explaining decisions or actions to a human observer, and it should not be controversial to say that looking at how humans explain to each other can serve as a useful starting point for explanation in artificial intelligence. However, it is fair to say that most work in explainable artificial intelligence uses only the researchers' intuition of what constitutes a ‘good' explanation. There exist vast and valuable bodies of research in philosophy, psychology, and cognitive science of how people define, generate, select, evaluate, and present explanations, which argues that people employ certain cognitive biases and social expectations to the explanation process. This paper argues that the field of explainable artificial intelligence can build on this existing research, and reviews relevant papers from philosophy, cognitive psychology/science, and social psychology, which study these topics. It draws out some important findings, and discusses ways that these can be infused with work on explainable artificial intelligence.},

Since the introduction of the embodied cognition framework in cognitive and social psychology, numerous studies have demonstrated links between everyday bodily experiences and product evaluations involving meaning portrayal and affect. To date, however, no comprehensive framework for understanding embodiment in relation to design experience has been developed. Hence, one goal of this article is to set out a typology for understanding embodiment in relation to multi-sensory product appearance and action. A second goal is showing why insights from embodiment may be inspiring and useful to designers and why understanding of the embodied dynamics underlying product experience may guide designers in creating meaningful objects. To substantiate these assumptions, we present the different types of embodiment most relevant in relation to design research accompanied by examples. We expand on the design goals that might underlie these different types, suggesting new avenues for design and design research based on our research propositions and findings.},

These methods and strategies should not only present scientific findings as images in a concise way but also need to be effective and expressive, which often remain untested. Here, we present Versus, a tool to enable easy image quality assessment and image ranking, utilizing a two-alternative forced choice methodology (2AFC)and an efficient ranking algorithm based on a binary search. The tool provides a systematic way of setting up evaluation experiments via the web without the necessity to install any additional software or require any programming skills. Furthermore, Versus can easily interface with crowdsourcing platforms, such as Amazon's Mechanical Turk, or can be used as a stand-alone system to carry out evaluations with experts. We demonstrate the use of Versus by means of an image evaluation study, aiming to determine if hue, saturation, brightness, and texture are good indicators of uncertainty in three-dimensional protein structures. Drawing from the power of crowdsourcing, we argue that there is demand and also great potential for this tool to become a standard for simple and fast image evaluations, with the aim to test the effectiveness and expressiveness of scientific visualizations.},

abstract = {In our experiences of teaching design students and working with design professionals, we have often observed the great importance of inspiration even if students and professionals approach design in various ways. Moreover, we often find that presenting a designer with stimuli at the initial stages of a design inspires the generation of new ideas. This paper aims to discover the relationship between the similarity of visual stimuli and the creativity generated by visual stimuli in the conceptual synthesizing process. This represents the most frequently employed design idea generation technique. The results showed that the concept pairs from different categories had a lower level of similarity than the concept pairs from the same category. In regards to the creativity of the design idea sketches, the concept pairs from different categories obtained higher creativity scores than the concept pairs in the same category. However, there was no significant correlation between similarity and creativity, and the mode of representation of the concept pairs did not affect their perceived level of similarity. However, visual stimuli fostered more creativity than textual stimuli for concept pairs in different categories. In summary, the results of the study suggested an effective way to promote design idea generation and fostering creativity by presenting similar concept images selected from different categories.

abstract = {Previous work has shown that non-verbal behav-iors affect anthropomorphic inferences about artificial com-municators such as virtual agents or social robots. In an ex-periment with a humanoid robot we investigated the effects of the robot's hand and arm gestures on the perception of humanlikeness, likability of the robot, shared reality, and fu-ture contact intentions after interacting with the robot. For this purpose, the speech-accompanying non-verbal behav-iors of the humanoid robot were manipulated in three exper-imental conditions: (1) no gesture, (2) congruent co-verbal gesture, and (3) incongruent co-verbal gesture. We hypoth-esized higher ratings on all dependent measures in the two multimodal (i.e., speech and gesture) conditions compared to the unimodal (i.e., speech only) condition. The results confirm our predictions: when the robot used co-verbal ges- tures during interaction, it was anthropomorphized more, participants perceived it as more likable, reported greater shared reality with it, and showed increased future con-tact intentions than when the robot gave instructions with-out gestures. Surprisingly, this effect was particularly pro-nounced when the robot's gestures were partly incongru-ent with speech, although this behavior negatively affected the participants' task-related performance. These findings show that communicative non-verbal behaviors displayed by robotic systems affect anthropomorphic perceptions and the mental models humans form of a humanoid robot during in-teraction.},

abstract = {Emotional pictures guide selective visual attention. A series of event-related brain potential (ERP) studies is reviewed demonstrating the consistent and robust modulation of specific ERP components by emotional images. Specifically, pictures depicting natural pleasant and unpleasant scenes are associated with an increased early posterior negativity, late positive potential, and sustained positive slow wave compared with neutral contents. These modulations are considered to index different stages of stimulus processing including perceptual encoding, stimulus representation in working memory, and elaborate stimulus evaluation. Furthermore, the review includes a discussion of studies exploring the interaction of motivated attention with passive and active forms of attentional control. Recent research is reviewed exploring the selective processing of emotional cues as a function of stimulus novelty, emotional prime pictures, learned stimulus significance, and in the context of explicit attention tasks. It is concluded that ERP measures are useful to assess the emotion-attention interface at the level of distinct processing stages. Results are discussed within the context of two-stage models of stimulus perception brought out by studies of attention, orienting, and learning.},

In this paper, the practice of mindfulness meditation is used as heuristic, arguing for a view of mindfulness meditation as a formalized de-specialization of the infinite number of other activities with which people can achieve mindfulness. Sitting meditation, requiring of one to observe the contents of their mind unmediated, can serve as a useful model for the musician in understanding the phenomenology of the music-making process and the "flow" states that can result from an embodied musical practice. Finally, reconceptualizing music-making as a mindfulness practice is considered with psychological and pedagogical implications relevant for developing musicians.},

The developed framework allows the testing of MASs based on JADE or JADEX platforms. In addition, this framework offers a set of configurable Mock Agents with the aim of being able to execute tests while the MAS is under development. The BEAST Methodology presents transparent traceability from user requirements to test cases. Thus, the stakeholders can be aware of the project status. The methodology and the associated tool have been validated in the development of a MAS for fault diagnosis in FTTH (Fiber To The Home) networks. The results have been measured in quantifiable way obtaining a reduction of the tests implementation time.},

One relatively recent word-of-mouth customer loyalty metric purported that the link to growth is the Net Promoter Score (NPS), a metric based on a likelihood to recommend question asked in customer surveys. This research provides a summary of the claims made regarding NPS, reviews the research conducted on this topic to date, and provides a holistic examination of two scientific studies that test the claims made. The two claims being tested are that (1) NPS is the single most reliable indicator of a company's ability to grow and (2) NPS is superior to customer satisfaction and the latter has no link to growth. Based on both macro- and micro-level investigations that test the link between NPS and firm growth and NPS and customer behaviour metrics respectively, our research finds that neither of these claims are supported.Journal of Database Marketing {\&} Customer Strategy Management (2008) 15, 79–90. doi:10.1057/dbm.2008.4; published online 12 May 2008 [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

We compare a range of off-the-shelf sentiment analysis tools to manually coded economic news as well as examine the agreement between these dictionary approaches themselves. We assess the performance of five off-the-shelf sentiment analysis tools and two tailor-made dictionary-based approaches. The analyses result in five conclusions. First, there is little overlap between the off-the-shelf tools; causing wide divergence in terms of tone measurement. Second, there is no stronger overlap with manual coding for short texts (i.e., headlines) than for long texts (i.e., full articles). Third, an approach that combines individual dictionaries achieves a comparably good performance. Fourth, precision may increase to acceptable levels at higher levels of granularity. Fifth, performance of dictionary approaches depends more on the number of relevant keywords in the dictionary than on the number of valenced words as such; a small tailor-made lexicon was not inferior to large established dictionaries. Altogether, we conclude that off-the-shelf sentiment analysis tools are mostly unreliable and unsuitable for research purposes–at least in the context of Dutch economic news–and manual validation for the specific language, domain, and genre of the research project at hand is always warranted.},

Experts in the domain in question serve as judges; thus, for a study of creativity using stories and poems, a panel of writers and/or teachers of creative writing might judge the creativity of the stories, and a separate panel of poets and/or poetry critics might judge the creativity of the poems. The Consensual Assessment Technique is based on the idea that the best measure of the creativity of a work of art, a theory, a research proposal, or any other artifact is the combined assessment of experts in that field. Unlike other measures of creativity, such as divergent-thinking tests, the Consensual Assess- ment Technique is not based on any particular theory of creativity, which means that its validity (which has been well established empirically) is not dependent upon the validity of any particular theory of creativity. This chapter explains the Consensual Assessment Technique, discusses how it has been used in research, and explores ways it might be employed in assessment in higher education.},

The goal throughout is to refine a set of critical questions about A.I. and economic growth and to contribute to shaping an agenda for the field.

In particular, wisely applying the first-person perspective in projects that require great sensitivity can be a major contributor to design outcomes. As such, a better understanding of the relative value of the first-person perspective compared to—and combined with—other fundamental perspectives (introduced as perspective transitions and clusters) can contribute to enrich and develop design methodologies. In this paper we report on a case study targeting mourning. We describe when and how junior designers employed the first-, second-, and third-person perspectives and how they were combined. This leads to new insights. First, we improve the current understanding of perspectives. Second, we identify the specific value of transitions between perspectives. Third, we introduce perspective clusters and highlight how these—as building blocks—can give flexible guidance to design. These insights, in turn, support a mixed-perspectives approach. This approach supports empathic design by enabling designers to be receptive, inclusive, and committed toward users. Moreover, it supports designers in employing (relevant) personal experiences and intuition in a more credible and intentional way.},

James Clerck Maxwell (1831-1879) analyzed the stability of Watt's governor [Maxwell, 1868]. His idea was to linearize the differential equation of motion in order to find the characteristic equation of the system. He proved that the system is stable if the roots of the characteristic equation have negative real parts.

Later, Edward Routh (1831-1907) provided a numerical technique for determining when a polynomial has negative roots, giving a treatise on the stability of a given state of motion [Routh, 1877]. 

Using differential equations, independently of Maxwell, Vishnegradsky [1877] analyzed the stability of regulators.

But, the most elegant and general theory of stability was created by Alexander Lyapunov (1857-1918). He studied the stability of nonlinear differential equations using a generalized notion of energy [Lyapunov, 1893]. He introduced some concepts and techniques which are still in use.},

abstract = {This paper presents the key algorithmic techniques behind CatBoost, a new gradient boosting toolkit. Their combination leads to CatBoost outperforming other publicly available boosting implementations in terms of quality on a variety of datasets. Two critical algorithmic advances introduced in CatBoost are the implementation of ordered boosting, a permutation-driven alternative to the classic algorithm, and an innovative algorithm for processing categorical features. Both techniques were created to fight a prediction shift caused by a special kind of target leakage present in all currently existing implementations of gradient boosting algorithms. In this paper, we provide a detailed analysis of this problem and demonstrate that proposed algorithms solve it effectively, leading to excellent empirical results.},

The measure's psychometric properties and relationships with other personality attributes were described. Three studies exploring behavioral correlates of confidence demonstrated the following: People's expressed self-confidence is consistent with others' appraisals of their confidence; when given a choice between two activities, people choose the one on which their confidence is higher; and less confident people perceive their futures, although not those of other people, less favorably than highly confident people. The importance of distinguishing and assessing both domain-specific and general confidence is discussed.},

However, when participants made JOLs prior to studying each item and engaged in multiple study-test sessions, their JOLs accurately reflected recall, as well as when serial position information was explicitly provided during the study phase. The findings are interpreted in a cue utilization framework and suggest that under certain conditions, participants can predict primacy and recency effects.},

As complexity rises within the internal and external environments that organizations operate within, it is no longer acceptable to be able to perform well when things go as expected; instead individuals, teams, and organizations must be able to continuously adapt their knowledge and skills in order to remain competitive in environments which are fluid, often ambiguous, and where multiple pathways to goal attainment exist. Thus, this volume takes a multi-disciplinary approach to increasing our understanding of adaptability within complex environments by integrating cutting-edge work done by experts in the field and compiling it in one volume. Specifically, the volume takes a systems approach in that chapters describe the manifestation and antecedents of adaptability at individual, team, and organizational levels. In addition, the volume presents work on the importance of cultural adaptability, visualization requirements, measurement approaches, training strategies, and selection for adaptive performance.},

Drawing on exploration and individual motivation theories, we developed and tested a model examining the effects of hedonic (i.e., personal innovativeness and cognitive absorption) and instrumental (i.e., performance expectancy and image enhancement) factors on individuals' intentions to explore a technology over time. Based on a study of 94 users exposed to a new technology, with measurements taken at two points in time, we found that both instrumental and hedonic factors affect individuals' intentions to explore, but their effects change over time such that as time goes by, the effect of personal innovativeness decreases and performance expectancy increases. In addition to our contributions and implications for research on technology acceptance, we present practical implications both for developers and managers, with a view toward helping the development and deployment of technologies that satisfy the evolution of users' needs over time. {\textcopyright}2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

As shown by previous research, GPS-tagged Twitter data enables the prediction of future crimes in a major city, Chicago, Illinois, of the United States. However, existing crime prediction models that incorporate data from Twitter have limitations in describing criminal incidents due to the absence of sentiment polarity and weather factors. The addition of sentiment analysis and weather predictors to such models would deliver significant insight about how crime. Our aim is to predict the time and location in which a specific type of crime will occur. Our approach is based on sentiment analysis by applying lexicon-based methods and understanding of categorized weather data, combined with kernel density estimation based on historical crime incidents and prediction via linear modeling. By testing our model's ability to predict future crime on each area of the city, we observed that the model surpassed the benchmark model, which predicts crime incidents using kernel density estimation.},

Researchers and practicing managers contend that design engineers may play an important role in product development efforts. However, their effect on the product development process is not well understood and the extent of their impact on product development performance has not been adequately accessed. This research defines the changing role of design engineers, and it discusses their impact on setting clear project targets and sharing knowledge about customers. The study investigates the impact of these variables on product development productivity. Data collected from 205 manufacturing firms were used to create valid and reliable instruments to assess role change of design engineers, clarity of project targets, shared knowledge about customers and product development productivity. Results from structural equation modeling indicate that as the role of design engineers expands the clarity of project targets increase. This increase impacts the extent of shared knowledge about customers. Increases in the clarity of project targets and shared knowledge about customers appear to enhance product development productivity. {\textcopyright}2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Two studies of university undergraduates used novel measures to explore sex differences and intrasexual variation in mate preferences and sexual behavior. Study 1 used photographs of models to assess the effects of sex of subject and target persons' ambition/income on judgments of dating, sexual, and marital desirability, and analyzed these effects' associations with subjects' sexual attitudes and behavior (Simpson's and Gangestad's Sociosexual Orientation Inventory [SOI]). Results were consistent with the proposed model of mate selection: for men, potential partners' physical attributes establish a pool of coitally acceptable partners, some of whom may merit long-term investment. When women choose partners, nonphysical characteristics such as ambition, status, and dominance establish a pool of partners who are potentially acceptable for sexual relations and higher-investment relationships. Target persons' ambition/income strongly affected women's, but not men's, reported willingness to date and have sex with target persons, and the effects on women were not associated with their SOI scores. Study 2 used photographs of models in bathing suits to explore sex differences in the capacity to determine coital acceptability by means of a visual scan, what types of information men and women need in addition to a visual scan in order to determine coital acceptability, and whether these variables are associated with subjects' SOI scores. Results were consistent with the hypotheses. Women with high SOI scores require fewer signs of male willingness to invest in order to engage in sexual relations than do women with low scores. Nevertheless, the two groups have essentially the same perceptual filters and criteria in mate selection, and these differ dramatically from those of men. A "Tradeoff-threshold" model of mate evaluation is described, and its compatibility with Singh's models is discussed. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Inc},

abstract = {A recent concern of the U.S. Army's top leadership has been the deterioration of morale and cohesion in combat arms units. High personnel turnover in U.S. Army units has been viewed as a primary factor contributing to decreased unit cohesiveness. The current and traditional U.S. Army Indi- vidual Replacement (IR) System trained, assigned, and deployed soldiers to units as individuals. As a result, IR units have had as much as 45{\{}{\%}{\}} personnel turnover annually. The new Unit Replacement (UR) System trained, assigned, and deployed soldiers as intact groups for the entire first-term soldier's enlistment. The objective of the study was to examine the effects of unit replacement on cohesion and to elaborate on the function of cohesion by examining the relationship between cohesion and social support in a sample of 3,245 soldiers in 43 line companies matched by type of replacement, type of combat arms, and stateside/overseas deployment. Soldiers in UR units in which soldiers had previously undergone Basic and Advanced Individual Training together or had their personnel stabilized reported a significantly higher level of cohesion than did soldiers in IR units. This difference persisted even when personal and unit characteristics were held constant in compari- sons. In terms of social support, UR soldiers cited more support providers in their units than did IR soldiers. Perceived satisfaction with social support and perceived helpfulness of social support provided by unit members were significantly and positively correlated with the cohesion measures, irrespective of the type of replacement. Whereas reciprocity was significantly and positively related to cohesion in commonly trained UR and IR units, it was nonsignificantly related to cohesion in personnel-stabilized UR units. Impli- cations of results for the expected effects of cohesion on the quality of interpersonal relations among unit members are discussed.},

abstract = {This paper frames design knowledge as formalizable physical actions that can more fully exploit future design tools and production methods. As computational design tools become more physically interactive and integrated into our environment we need new research frameworks to develop theories of physical design action as a form of knowledge. Symbolic theories of design knowledge traditionally frame design activity as a mental process and as a result researchers have not fully explored the potential for bodily-based computational design knowledge. We present an action-based design notation drawing inspiration from music performance theory to illustrate how this may impact design research. We discuss findings from situated cognition in cognitive science as an alternative framework for exploring and expanding design knowledge. We conclude with suggestions for future work in robotic-aided design cognition.},

Our method combines two weakly supervised components to identify salient opinions and form extractive summaries from multiple reviews: an aspect extractor trained under a multi-task objective, and a sentiment predictor based on multiple instance learning. We introduce an opinion summarization dataset that includes a training set of product reviews from six diverse domains and human-annotated development and test sets with gold standard aspect annotations, salience labels, and opinion summaries. Automatic evaluation shows significant improvements over baselines, and a large-scale study indicates that our opinion summaries are preferred by human judges according to multiple criteria.},

Relative to control conditions, this procedure enhanced implicit self-esteem. The effects generalized across 3 measures of implicit self-esteem (Experiments 1-3). Furthermore, evaluative conditioning enhanced implicit self-esteem among people with low-temporal implicit self-esteem and among people with high-temporal implicit self-esteem (Experiment 4). In addition, it was shown that conditioning enhanced self-esteem to such an extent that it made participants insensitive to negative intelligence feedback (Experiments 5a and 5b).

This 4-day quantitative diary study (N = 100 employees, N = 367-400 data points) aims to shed light on the relationship between daily smartphone use and daily work-home interference (WHI). Two potential moderators of this relationship are examined: (1) (strong) social norms represented by the influence of colleagues and supervisors regarding availability after work hours and (2) work engagement. Overall, the results of multilevel analyses were in line with the hypotheses. The findings suggest that supervisors should be clear about their expectations regarding smartphone use in private hours in that they should not expect employees to be always available. In addition we conclude that engaged workers can prevent work from interfering too much with their private lives, even when they use their smartphones during evening hours. {\textcopyright}2014 The British Psychological Society.},

In this paper, we review the literature of empathic design, and we discuss our own experiences with introducing and practicing empathic design in several NPD projects at Philips Research over the past years. Having experimented with empathic design in an industrial context, we experienced success but also encountered eight challenges that relate to discrepancies between the theory of empathic design as described in literature on the one hand, and the application of empathic design in an industrial context on the other. Three cultural and methodological changes are proposed for addressing these challenges in the future. These include changing focus (a) from rational approaches to including empathic approaches, (b) from users as informers to users as partners in NPD practice, and (c) from being informed of user research to being engaged in user research. The first two changes strongly resonate with Sanders' (2006) dimensions of change. The third dimension is new, and highlights an area of empathic design that is largely unaddressed in the literature.},

It is an important feature for distinguishing materials by means of touch. In order to quantitatively describe the ability of human observers to discriminate between materials on the basis of heat extraction rate, we conducted an experiment in which this heat extraction was performed in a controlled way. In different conditions, subjects were repeatedly asked to select from two stimuli the one that cooled faster. The discrimination threshold was around 43{\%} of the extraction rate. A rate that was twice as slow also yielded twice the absolute threshold. When we halved the temperature difference between the beginning and end of the stimulus, the threshold did not change as much. In separate experiments, we investigated the different cues that were available in the stimulus: initial cooling rate and end temperature. Both cues were used for discrimination, but cooling rate seemed to be the most important.},

abstract = {User engagement (UE) and its measurement have been of increasing interest in human-computer interaction (HCI). The User Engagement Scale (UES) is one tool developed to measure UE, and has been used in a variety of digital domains. The original UES consisted of 31-items and purported to measure six dimensions of engagement: aesthetic appeal, focused attention, novelty, perceived usability, felt involvement, and endurability. A recent synthesis of the literature questioned the original six-factors. Further, the ways in which the UES has been implemented in studies suggests there may be a need for a briefer version of the questionnaire and more effective documentation to guide its use and analysis. This research investigated and verified a four-factor structure of the UES and proposed a Short Form (SF). We employed contemporary statistical tools that were unavailable during the UES' development to re-analyze the original data, consisting of 427 and 779 valid responses across two studies, and examined new data (N=344) gathered as part of a three-year digital library project. In this paper we detail our analyses, present a revised long and short form (SF) version of the UES, and offer guidance for researchers interested in adopting the UES and UES-SF in their own studies.},

British university students (N=307) completed the Alternate Uses Test and Big Five personality inventory at the beginning of the first academic year. Students' academic performance was assessed throughout a 4-year period via written exams, continuous assessment (tutored seminars) and a supervised dissertation in the final year. Creative thinking was more related to final dissertation marks than to exam and continuous assessment performance (which were associated with Conscientiousness, rather than creative thinking). A follow-up questionnaire on preferences for different assessment methods revealed that creative thinking was positively related to preference for viva voce (oral) exams, group projects and final dissertation, but negatively associated with preferences for multiple-choice and essay-type exams, as well as continuous assessment. Implications are discussed with regard to educational settings, in particular assessment methods. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {A fundamental question about the relationship between cognition and emotion concerns the neural substrate underlying emotional self-regulation. To address this issue, brain activation was measured in normal male subjects while they either responded in a normal manner to erotic film excerpts or voluntarily attempted to inhibit the sexual arousal induced by viewing erotic stimuli. Results demonstrated that the sexual arousal experienced, in response to the erotic film excerpts, was associated with activation in "limbic" and paralimbic structures, such as the right amygdala, right anterior temporal pole, and hypothalamus. In addition, the attempted inhibition of the sexual arousal generated by viewing the erotic stimuli was associated with activation of the right superior frontal gyrus and right anterior cingulate gyrus. No activation was found in limbic areas. These findings reinforce the view that emotional self-regulation is normally implemented by a neural circuit comprising various prefrontal regions and subcortical limbic structures. They also suggest that humans have the capacity to influence the electrochemical dynamics of their brains, by voluntarily changing the nature of the mind processes unfolding in the psychological space.},

In the first two experiments, par- ticipants completed visual tasks that forced them to fo- cus perceptual attention on a comparatively broad or narrow visual area. As predicted, broad, compared to narrow initial focusing of perceptual attention subse- quently led to generation of more original uses for a brick (Experiment 1) and generation of more unusual category exemplars (Experiment 2). In Experiment 3, participants were merely asked to contract their frontalis versus corrugator muscles, producing rudi- mentary peripheral feedback associated with broad versus narrow perceptual focus. As predicted, frontalis contraction, relative to corrugator contraction, led to the production of more original uses for a pair of scis- sors. Together, these three experiments provided con- verging initial support for our attentional priming hypothesis, suggesting that situationally induced vari- ations in the scope of perceptual attention (and simple cues associated with such variations) may corre- spondingly expand or constrict the focus of conceptual attention within the semantic network, thereby improv- ing or diminishing creativity.},

We tested impressions of faces at full-frontal, three-quarter, and profile views. Judgments of personality (aggressiveness, competence, dominance, likeability, and trustworthiness) and physiognomy (attractiveness and facial maturity) were significantly correlated across full-frontal, three-quarter, and profile views of male faces. When under time pressure, with only a 50 ms exposure to each face, the correlations for profile with full-frontal and three-quarter view judgments of personality (but not physiognomy) dropped considerably. However, judgments of the full-frontal and three-quarter faces were significantly correlated across the self-paced and 50 ms viewing durations. These findings therefore show that perceptions of full faces lead to relatively similar interferences across both viewing angle and time.},

Need fulfillment was consistently associated with SWB across world regions. Life evaluation was most associated with fulfilling basic needs; positive feelings were most associated with social and respect needs; and negative feelings were most associated with basic, respect, and autonomy needs. Societal need fulfillment predicted SWB, particularly for life evaluation, beyond individuals' fulfillment of their own needs, indicating the desirability of living in a flourishing society. In addition, the associations of SWB with the fulfillment of specific needs were largely independent of whether other needs were fulfilled. These trends persisted when household income was taken into account. The emergent ordering of need fulfillment for psychosocial needs were fairly consistent across country conditions, but the fulfillment of basic and safety needs were contingent on country membership.},

abstract = {Social comparison processes include the desire to affiliate with others, the desire for information about others, and explicit self-evaluation against others. Previously these types of comparison activity and their corresponding measures have been treated as interchangeable. We present evidence that in certain groups under threat, these comparison activities diverge, with explicit self-evaluation made against a less fortunate target (downward evaluation), but information and affiliation sought out from more fortunate others (upward contacts). These effects occur because downward evaluation and upward contacts appear to serve different needs, the former ameliorating self-esteem and the latter enabling a person to improve his or her situation and simultaneously increase motivation and hope. Implications for the concept, measurement, and theory of social comparison are discussed.},

abstract = {Paul Paulus is Distinguished Professor of Psychology at the Department of Psychology, University of Texas at Arlington. Paul Paulus's research interests revolve around Group Creativity: On the one hand, creative processes are often conceptualized as individual-level phenomena. On the other hand, complex problems in innovation management often need the collaboration of various experts to create novel solutions. Interestingly, although common sense suggests that individuals are more creative in a group context, research indicates that this is oftentimes not the case. The question on how to structure creative processes in groups in such a way that groups can actually benefit from their creative potential is therefore crucial. Paul Paulus has spent much of his academic career addressing this intriguing question. He and his research team have discovered many factors that influence group creativity and have been able to demonstrate conditions under which group interaction enhances creativity. For the past eight years he has been working with a multidisciplinary team to better understand the cognitive, neural and social factors that underlie the group creative process ( Paulus et al., ). They are presently funded on a three year project to investigate innovation processes in networks. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

During data collection a new stage of recall occurs just prior to the JOL, so that during data analysis the items can be partitioned into subcategories to measure the degree of JOL accuracy in ways that are more analytic than was previously possible. A weighted-average combinatorial rule allows the component measures of JOL accuracy to be combined into the usual overall measure of metacognitive accuracy. An example using the revised methodology offers a new explanation for the delayed-JOL effect, in which delayed JOLs are more accurate than immediate JOLs for predicting recall.},

abstract = {The development of agents that can engage in human social interaction has become critical in an increasingly wide range of applications. The focus of this work is modeling agents for social skills training where learners can interact with the autonomous characters in social scenarios and thereby acquire skills that can be applied in the real world. A key goal in the design of these systems is to allow users to explore various actions and tactics while still having the agents generate consistent and diverse responses. Providing the ability to explore different tactics raises a significant content challenge for the design of agents. To tackle the creative content creation problem, this paper introduces a humans-in-the-loop iterative process to automatically generate rich, varied content from a small amount of vignettes provided by online crowd workers. Specifically, this process uses the crowd to iteratively refine and improve an ensemble of generative models. The results show that the iterative, ensemble based approach generates more coherent and novel interactions than alternative non-ensemble, non-iterative approaches. The results presented in this paper can potentially provide the basis for flexible agent-based training systems.},

abstract = {Stimulus complexity is an important determinant of aesthetic preference. An influential idea is that increases in stimulus complexity lead to increased preference up to an optimal point after which preference decreases (inverted-U pattern). However, whereas some studies indeed observed this pattern, most studies instead showed an increased preference for more complexity. One complicating issue is that it remains unclear how to define complexity. To address this, we approached complexity and its relation to aesthetic preference from a predictive coding perspective. Here, low- and high-complexity stimuli would correspond to low and high levels of prediction errors, respectively. We expected participants to prefer stimuli which are neither too easy to predict (low prediction error), nor too difficult (high prediction error). To test this, we presented two sequences of tones on each trial that varied in predictability from highly regular (low prediction error) to completely random (high prediction error), and participants had to indicate which of the two sequences they preferred in a two-interval forced-choice task. The complexity of each tone sequence (amount of prediction error) was estimated using entropy. Results showed that participants tended to choose stimuli with intermediate complexity over those of high or low complexity. This confirms the century-old idea that stimulus complexity has an inverted-U relationship to aesthetic preference.},

abstract = {Much recent research has been devoted to learning algorithms for deep architectures such as Deep Belief Networks and stacks of auto-encoder variants, with impressive results obtained in several areas, mostly on vision and language data sets. The best results obtained on supervised learning tasks involve an unsupervised learning component, usually in an unsupervised pre-training phase. Even though these new algorithms have enabled training deep models, many questions remain as to the nature of this difficult learning problem. The main question investigated here is the following: how does unsupervised pre-training work? Answering this questions is important if learning in deep architectures is to be further improved. We propose several explanatory hypotheses and test them through extensive simulations. We empirically show the influence of pre-training with respect to architecture depth, model capacity, and number of training examples. The experiments confirm and clarify the advantage of unsupervised pre-training. The results suggest that unsupervised pre-training guides the learning towards basins of attraction of minima that support better generalization from the training data set; the evidence from these results supports a regularization explanation for the effect of pre-training.},

Objective: The aim of this study is to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Italian version of the Dispositional Flow Scale-2 (DFS-2), for use with Italian adults, young adults and adolescents. Method: In accordance with the guidelines for test adaptation, the scale has been translated with the method of back translation. The understanding of the item has been checked according to the latest standards on the culturally sensitive translation. The scale thus produced was administered to 843 individuals (of which 60.69{\%} female), between the ages of 15 and 74. The sample is balanced between workers and students. The main activities defined by the subjects allow the sample to be divided into three categories: students, workers, athletes (professionals and semi-professionals). Results: The confirmatory factor analysis, conducted using the Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLM), showed acceptable fit indexes. Reliability and validity have been verified, and structural invariance has been verified on 6 categories of Flow experience and for 3 subsamples with different with different fields of action. Correlational analysis shows significant high values between the nine dimensions. Conclusions: Our data confirmed the validity and reliability of the Italian DFS-2 in measuring Flow experiences. The scale is reliable for use with Italian adults, young adults and adolescents. The Italian version of the scale is suitable for the evaluation of the subjective tendency to experience Flow trait characteristic in different contest, as sport, study and work.},

The aim of this study was to clarify the family and work-related characteristics associated with perceived time pressure in a sample of Canadian working mothers and fathers. A telephone survey of 1160 employed parents (674 women and 486 men) conducted in a mid-size Canadian city in 2005 provided the data for this study. Results of the multiple linear regression analyses showed that both role occupancy and role quality was related to perceived time pressure and that the nature of these relationships depended on gender. For mothers, the following factors were associated with increased time pressure: occupancy of an unpaid caregiving role, parenting a child with at least one health/behavioral problem, and the perception of parenting as draining or anxiety provoking. Regarding the paid work environment, women who were categorized as high strain (i.e., high demands/low control) or active (high demands/high control) also reported higher levels of time pressure. For fathers, greater perceived time pressure was associated with: occupancy of the partner role, the perception of parenting as draining, being a multiple job holder and having a high strain (i.e., high demands/low control) or active (high demands/high control) psychosocial work environment. Limitations of the study are discussed as are the policy implications of the findings.},

Tabachnik p.717:
CFI (Bentler, 1988) values greater than .95 are often indicative of good-fitting models
CFI ...does a good job of estimating model fit even in small samples (Bentler, 1989)
RMSEA (Browne {\{}{\&}{\}}amp; Crudeck, 1993) ... Values of 0.06 or less indicate a good-fitting model relative to the model degrees of freedom.
...larger than 0.10 are indicative of poor-fitting models (Browne {\{}{\&}{\}}amp; Crudeck, 1993).
In small samples the RMSEA overrejected the true model, i.e. the value was too large ...
because of this problem, this index may be less perferable with small samples.
As with the CFI the choice of estimation method affects the size of the RMSEA.

These have been implemented in various fields including science, business, nursing, technology as well as engineering. This study used quantitative method of meta-analysis to synthesize the effect of several approaches to creativity, specifically in the field of technology and engineering across educational levels. Several databases such as EBSCOhost, ProQuest, Taylor {\&} Francis, SpringerLink, IEEE Electronic Library, Eric and Google Scholar were searched for articles that study the effectiveness of approach to creativity or related issues ranging from 2000-2012 timeframe. Based on 16 articles adopted, it was found that the grand mean effect size for creativity approaches is 1.02 with standard deviation of 0.72. This study also identified seven approaches and twelve different instruments used to enhance and measure creativity in term of product and individual creativity. The finding showed that the implemented creativity approaches have a positive effect on students creativity development. As such, it is recommended that further empirical research on the effect of creativity approaches need to be conducted specifically in technology and engineering to support these findings.},

abstract = {Four experiments examined the effects of happiness on the tendency to use stereotypes in social judgment. In each experiment, individuals who had been induced to feel happy rendered more stereotypic judgments than did those in a neutral mood. Experiment 1 demonstrated this phenome-non with a mood induction procedure that involved recalling life experiences. Experiments 2 and 3 suggested that the greater reliance on stereotypes evident in the judgments of happy individuals was not attributable to cognitive capacity deficits created by intrusive happy thoughts or by cognitively disruptive excitement or energetic arousal that may accompany the experience of happiness. In Experiment 4, happy individuals again were found to render more stereotypic judgments, except under conditions in which they had been told that they would be held accountable for their judg-ments. These results suggest that although happy people's tendency to engage in stereotypic thinking may be pervasive, they are quite capable of avoiding the influence of stereotypes in their judgments when situational factors provide a motivational impetus for such effort. Discovering the conditions under which group stereotypes are likely to be applied in forming impressions of and making judgments about individuals has been an issue of perennial in-terest in social psychology. Factors such as information overload (Pratto {\&} Bargh, 1991; Stangor {\&} Duan, 1991) and task diffi-culty (Bodenhausen {\&} Lichtenstein, 1987), for example, have been shown to increase the social perceiver's reliance on stereo-typic preconceptions (for a review, see Hamilton {\&} Sherman, in press). In the present research, we investigated the role of emotion, specifically happiness, in the application of stereo-types during social information processing. Does being happy have any impact on the likelihood of stereotyping others? If so, what is the mechanism involved? It was these questions that we sought to address. Interest in the relationship between emotion and stereotyping is certainly not new. However, previous attempts to understand the role of affective experience in prejudice and stereotyping have focused almost exclusively on the impact of negative emo-tions. Conventional wisdom indicates that it is during times of stress, anxiety, or hostility that prejudice and stereotypes are most likely to emerge and exert their influence on social percep-tion. Psychological research lends credence to the idea that an-ger, conflict, frustration, and anxiety are indeed associated with},

We answer positively and argue that approach movements lead to self-evaluative assimilation (a higher self-evaluation with a high vs. a low standard), while avoidance movements lead to self-evaluative contrast (a lower self-evaluation with a high vs. a low standard). Hence, we predict that approach/avoidance moderates the impact of comparison information on self-evaluation. To test this idea, participants were either primed with approach or avoidance before processing comparison information (Study 1) or physically had to walk toward or away from this information (Studies 2 and 3). Results on selfevaluated adjustment (Studies 1 and 2) and self-evaluated attractiveness measures (Study 3) confirmed our predictions. These studies suggest ways to behave to self-evaluate positively when hearing about others.},

abstract = {Learned helplessness, the failure to escape shock induced by uncontrollable aversive events, was discovered half a century ago. Seligman and Maier (1967) theorized that animals learned that outcomes were independent of their responses—that nothing they did mattered—and that this learning undermined trying to escape. The mechanism of learned helplessness is now very well-charted biologically, and the original theory got it backward. Passivity in response to shock is not learned. It is the default, unlearned response to prolonged aversive events and it is mediated by the serotonergic activity of the dorsal raphe nucleus, which in turn inhibits escape. This passivity can be overcome by learning control, with the activity of the medial prefrontal cortex, which subserves the detection of control leading to the automatic inhibition of the dorsal raphe nucleus. So animals learn that they can control aversive events, but the passive failure to learn to escape is an unlearned reaction to prolonged aversive stimulation. In addition, alterations of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex-dorsal raphe pathway can come to subserve the expectation of control. We speculate that default passivity and the compensating detection and expec- tation of control may have substantial implications for how to treat depression.

Patients participated in one of three conditions: a dance group performing a traditional upbeat circle dance, a group that listened just to the music of the dance (music only), and a group that moved on a home trainer bike (ergometer) up to the same level of arousal as the dance group (movement only). While all three conditions alleviated or stabilized the condition of the patients, results suggest that patients in the dance group profited most from the intervention. They showed significantly less depression than participants in the music group (p {\textless} .001) and in the ergometer group (p {\textless} .05), and more vitality (p {\textless} .05) than participants in the music group on post-test self-report scales immediately after the intervention. Stimulating circle dances can thus have a positive effect on patients with depression and may be recommended for use in dance/movement therapy and other complementary therapies. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {In this paper, we present an algorithm that performs simplification of large geographical maps through a novel use of graphics hardware. Given a map as a collection of non-intersecting chains and a tolerance parameter for each chain, we produce a simplified map that resembles the original map, satisfying the condition that the distance between each point on the simplified chain and the original chain is within the given tolerance parameter, and that no two chains intersect. In conjunction with this, we also present an out-of-core system for interactive visualization of these maps. We represent the maps hierarchically and employ different pruning strategies to accelerate the rendering. Our algorithm uses a parallel approach to do rendering as well as fetching data from the disk in a synchronous manner. We have applied our algorithm to a gigabyte sized map dataset. The memory overhead of our algorithm (the amount of main memory it requires) is output sensitive and is typically tens of megabytes, much smaller than the actual data size.},

abstract = {It has been proposed that animals and humans might choose a speed-accuracy tradeoff that maximizes reward rate. For this utility function the simple drift-diffusion model of two-alternative forced-choice tasks predicts a parameter-free optimal performance curve that relates normalized decision times to error rates under varying task conditions. However, behavioral data indicate that only ≈ 30 {\%} of subjects achieve optimality, and here we investigate the possibility that, in allowing for uncertainties, subjects might exercise robust strategies instead of optimal ones. We consider two strategies in which robustness is achieved by relinquishing performance: maximin and robust-satisficing. The former supposes maximization of guaranteed performance under a presumed level of uncertainty; the latter assumes that subjects require a critical performance level and maximize the level of uncertainty under which it can be guaranteed. These strategies respectively yield performance curves parameterized by a presumed uncertainty level and required performance. Maximin performance curves for uncertainties in response-to-stimulus interval match data for the lower-scoring 70 {\%} of subjects well, and are more likely to explain it than robust-satisficing or alternative optimal performance curves that emphasize accuracy. For uncertainties in signal-to-noise ratio, neither maximin nor robust-satisficing performance curves adequately describe the data. We discuss implications for decisions under uncertainties, and suggest further behavioral assays. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The influences of symmetry and averageness are often confounded in studies based on full-face views of faces. Two experiments are reported that compared the effect of manipulating the averageness of female faces in profile and full-face views. Use of a profile view allows a face to be "morphed" toward an average shape without creating an image that becomes more symmetrical. Faces morphed toward the average were perceived as more attractive in both views, but the effect was significantly stronger for full-face views. Both full-face and profile views morphed away from the average shape were perceived as less attractive. It is concluded that the effect of averageness is independent of any effect of symmetry on the perceived attractiveness of female faces.},

abstract = {Design thinking can be a powerful way to engage the world, allowing interactive understandings that are both analytic and experiential. When fully functioning, design thinking necessarily calls upon faculties often considered a-rational, a-causal and a-logical. Unfortunately, such faculties often give rise to academic suspicion. That is to say, the indeterminacies of design thinking often spawn unhelpful (and undermining) reductions. When this occurs, the fullness of design thinking gets channelled into a series of steps, rules of thumb or professional categories, thereby diluting its potency. In order to encourage a richer image of design thinking, particularly for the education of design students, this article explores ways to complement more familiar logical understandings of the design process with the functional complexity of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari's 'rhizome'. As a heuristic device, the rhizome and its related concepts are employed to provide a more complete picture of design thinking and to develop a practice that imbues design work with meaningful complexity. In this way, the rhizome promotes design thinking as a process comprised of both linear and non-linear aspects.},

The reliability and validity of the Smartphone Addiction Inventory (SPAI) was demonstrated. Methods A total of 283 participants were recruited from Dec. 2012 to Jul. 2013 to complete a set of questionnaires, including a 26-item SPAI modified from the Chinese Internet Addiction Scale and phantom vibration and ringing syndrome questionnaire. There were 260 males and 23 females, with ages 22.9±2.0 years. Exploratory factor analysis, internal-consistency test, test-retest, and correlation analysis were conducted to verify the reliability and validity of the SPAI. Correlations between each subscale and phantom vibration and ringing were also explored. Results Exploratory factor analysis yielded four factors: compulsive behavior, functional impairment, withdrawal and tolerance. Test–retest reliabilities (intraclass correlations = 0.74–0.91) and internal consistency (Cronbach's {\$}\alpha{\$} = 0.94) were all satisfactory. The four subscales had moderate to high correlations (0.56–0.78), but had no or very low correlation to phantom vibration/ringing syndrome. Conclusion This study provides evidence that the SPAI is a valid and reliable, self-administered screening tool to investigate smartphone addiction. Phantom vibration and ringing might be independent entities of smartphone addiction.},

abstract = {The new psychological disorder of Internet addiction is fast accruing both popular and professional recognition. Past studies have indicated that some patterns of Internet use are associated with loneliness, shyness, anxiety, depression, and self-consciousness, but there appears to be little consensus about Internet addiction disorder. This exploratory study attempted to examine the potential influences of personality variables, such as shyness and locus of control, online experiences, and demographics on Internet addiction. Data were gathered from a convenient sample using a combination of online and offline methods. The respondents comprised 722 Internet users mostly from the Net-generation. Results indicated that the higher the tendency of one being addicted to the Internet, the shyer the person is, the less faith the person has, the firmer belief the person holds in the irresistible power of others, and the higher trust the person places on chance in determining his or her own course of life. People who are addicted to the Internet make intense and frequent use of it both in terms of days per week and in length of each session, especially for online communication via e-mail, ICQ, chat rooms, newsgroups, and online games. Furthermore, full-time students are more likely to be addicted to the Internet, as they are considered high-risk for problems because of free and unlimited access and flexible time schedules. Implications to help professionals and student affairs policy makers are addressed.},

abstract = {Design-based learning (DBL) is an educational approach grounded in the processes of inquiry and reasoning towards generating innovative artifacts, systems and solutions. The approach is well characterized in the context of learning natural sciences in secondary education. Less is known, however, of its characteristics in the context of higher engineering education. The purpose of this review study is to identify key characteristics of DBL in higher engineering education. From the tenets of engineering design practices and higher engineering education contexts we identified four relevant dimensions for organizing these characteristics: the project characteristics, the role of the teacher, the assessment methods, and the social context. Drawing on these four dimensions, we systematically reviewed the state-of-the-art empirical literature on DBL or DBL-like educational projects in higher engineering education. Based on this review we conclude that DBL projects consist of open-ended, hands-on, authentic and multidisciplinary design tasks resembling the community of engineering professionals. Teachers facilitate both the process of gaining domain-specific knowledge and the thinking activities relevant to propose innovative solutions. Teachers scaffold students in the development from novice to expert engineers. Assessment is characterized by formative and summative of both individual and team products and processes and by the use of a variety of assessment instruments. Finally, the social context of DBL projects includes peer-to-peer collaboration in which students work in teams. The implications of these findings for further research on DBL in higher engineering education are discussed.},

Results from 109 four-person project teams working on an interdependent command and control simulator indicated that teams learned more when composed of individuals who were high in cognitive ability and when the workload was distributed evenly. Conversely, team learning was negatively affected when teams were composed of individuals who were high in Agreeableness.

In addition, this study examined the effects of personal and group outcomes on backlash and explored two individual difference variables, gender and orientation toward other ethnic groups, as potential moderators of the proposed relationships. Backlash was operationalized in four ways: an affect-based measure (negative emotions), two cognitive-based measures (attitude toward the diversity program, perceptions of unfairness of promotion procedures), and a behavioral-intentions-based measure (organizational commitment). Results indicated that the diversity management justification was associated with more favorable support of the diversity initiative, and that unfavorable personal and group outcomes adversely affected backlash reactions. There was no empirical support for the influence of the moderator variables on the proposed relationships, however, a main effect for gender was found. Implications of the study's findings and future research directions are discussed.},

abstract = {In complex multivariate data sets, different features usually include diverse associations with different variables, and different variables are associated within different regions. Therefore, exploring the associations between variables and voxels locally becomes necessary to better understand the underlying phenomena. In this paper, we propose a co-analysis framework based on biclusters, which are two subsets of variables and voxels with close scalar-value relationships, to guide the process of visually exploring multivariate data. We first automatically extract all meaningful biclusters, each of which only contains voxels with a similar scalar-value pattern over a subset of variables. These biclusters are organized according to their variable sets, and biclusters in each variable set are further grouped by a similarity metric to reduce redundancy and support diversity during visual exploration. Biclusters are visually represented in coordinated views to facilitate interactive exploration of multivariate data from the similarity between biclusters and the correlation of scalar values with different variables. Experiments on several representative multivariate scientific data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in exploring local relationships among variables, biclusters and scalar values in the data.},

abstract = {Observers consciously prefer Mondrian's paintings in their original orientation compared with a rotated position-the " oblique effect" (Latto, Brain, {\&} Kelly, 2000). However, this finding's premise, that all vertical-horizontal orientations of the thick black lines in Mondrian's oeuvre are preferred, overlooks the fact that the overall balance of these images is also altered when they are reoriented. Thus, balance may regulate the oblique effect, which might influence conscious aesthetic preferences. To address this issue, we explore Hess's (1965, 1972) claim that observers will unconsciously increase their pupil diameter to pleasing images and constrict it to unpleasant images. We overcame Hess's methodological limitation of not keeping his images' luminances and contrast constant across conditions by presenting eight Mondrian paintings (1921-1944) to 30 observers on a CRT for 20 s each in either their original or seven rotated positions. Simultaneously, we measured their pupil size while asking them to report how (dis)pleasing they found each image. We found both evidence for the oblique effect (where image rotation hampers preference) and a correlation between this consciously reported aesthetic preference and unconsciously derived pupil size. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Psychological Association.},

abstract = {Little by little, newspapers are revealing the bright future that Artificial Intelligence (AI) is building. Intelligent machines will help everywhere. However, this bright future may have a possible dark side: a dramatic job market contraction before its unpredictable transformation. Hence, in a near future, large numbers of job seekers may need financial support while catching up with these novel unpredictable jobs. This possible job market crisis has an antidote inside. In fact, the rise of AI is sustained by the biggest knowledge theft of the recent years. Many learning AI machines are extracting knowledge from unaware skilled or unskilled workers by analyzing their interactions. By passionately doing their jobs, many of these workers are shooting themselves in the feet. In this paper, we propose Human-in-the-loop Artificial Intelligence (HitAI) as a fairer paradigm for AI systems. Recognizing that any AI system has humans in the loop, HitAI will reward these aware and unaware knowledge producers with a different scheme: decisions of AI systems generating revenues will repay the legitimate owners of the knowledge used for taking those decisions. As modern Merry Men, HitAI researchers should fight for a fairer Robin Hood Artificial Intelligence that gives back what it steals. This article is part of the special track on AI and Society.},

In the present data, monotonic functions, showing an increase in RT with decreasing JOL, were found when people were instructed to retrieve covertly or overtly and then make a JOL, as would be expected if retrieval fluency entirely determined JOLs. However, the functions for making uninstructed JOLs were different: Low JOLs were made quickly, not slowly, and the curves were inverted U shapes, rather than linear. Furthermore, people's memory performance was somewhat better, especially on low-JOL items, when they were instructed to first retrieve as opposed to when they were told only to make JOLs. To account for these data, we propose a two-stage model of JOLs, with the first stage occurring prior to attempted retrieval.},

We investigated this phenomenon by measuring two event-related potential (ERP) effects: the emotion effect (more positive ERPs for pleasant or unpleasant stimuli than for neutral stimuli) and the subsequent memory effect (more positive ERPs for subsequently remembered items than for subsequently forgotten items). ERPs were measured while subjects rated the emotional content of pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral pictures. As was expected, subsequent recall was better for pleasant and unpleasant pictures than for neutral pictures. The emotion effect was sensitive to arousal in parietal electrodes and to both arousal and valence in frontocentral electrodes. The subsequent memory effect at centroparietal electrodes was greater for emotional pictures than for neutral pictures during an early epoch (400-600 msec). This result suggests that emotional information has privileged access to processing resources, possibly leading to better memory formation.},

We approach this problem as video-to-video translation using pose as an intermediate representation. To transfer the motion, we extract poses from the source subject and apply the learned pose-to-appearance mapping to generate the target subject. We predict two consecutive frames for temporally coherent video results and introduce a separate pipeline for realistic face synthesis. Although our method is quite simple, it produces surprisingly compelling results (see video). This motivates us to also provide a forensics tool for reliable synthetic content detection, which is able to distinguish videos synthesized by our system from real data. In addition, we release a first-of-its-kind open-source dataset of videos that can be legally used for training and motion transfer.},

creativity as well as the pleasantness of the task more heavily in their preference ratings. 

In Study 2,
participants were given either a neutral or mood-threatening item generation task to perform. Results
illustrated that happy participants exhibited greater cognitive flexibility in all cases; when confronted with a
potentially mood-threatening task, happy participants were able to creatively transform the task so as to
maintain positive mood and interest. 

Finally, Study 3 manipulated participants' beliefs that moods could or could not be altered. 
Results replicated the standard positive mood-increased cognitive flexibility effect in the
nonmood-freezing condition, but no effects of mood on creativity were found in the mood-freezing condition.

These studies indicate that the hedonic contingency theory may be an important contributing mechanism

Moreover existing demonstrations of emotional support, though promising, only cover a small number of types of support and investigate a limited number of algorithms designed by hand. In this paper, we present an empirical investigation that starts from first principles, determining different categories of stressors for which emotional support might be useful, different categories of emotional support utterances and promising algorithms for deciding the content and form of textual emotional support messages according to the stressors present. At each stage, the results are validated through empirical experiments with human participants who, for instance, are required to place statements into categories, evaluate possible support messages in different imagined situations and compose their own emotional support from options offered. This development methodology allows us to avoid potentially challenging ethical issues in presenting people with stressful situations. Although our algorithms are attempting to choose emotional support based on the general, “naive” competence of human speakers, we use as a running example situations that can arise when attending a medical emergency and awaiting expert help.},

abstract = {In two experiments, the use of a self-other Implicit Association Test (IAT) as a measure of implicit self-esteem was examined. In Study 1, participants completed two self-other IATs: one in which the other was unspecified and one in which the other was specified to be a close friend. Esteem-IAT scores were significantly higher for the unspecified other-IAT (d = .82), indicating that the content of the other has a considerable influence on the over-all esteem-IAT scores. Study 2 provided a conceptual replication of these results and provided some initial evidence that the valence of an unspecified other is negative. Across both studies, the nature of the mental representation of the self, as measured by an esteem-IAT, changed as a function of the mental representation of the other. The crucial role of the other-associations in the esteem-IAT calls into question its use and interpretation as a measure of self-esteem.},

For a software application to be valuable it should have a user interface that is usable. Recently there has been some evidence that suggests using agile methods alone does not ensure that an applications UI is usable. As a result, there is currently interest in combining Agile methods with user-centered design (UCD) practices. To support existing empirical evidence that these methodologies co-exist effectively we have conducted a study with participants that have previously combined these two methodologies. Our findings, combined with existing work show that the existing model used for agile UCD integration can be broadened into a more common model. In this paper we describe three different approaches taken by our participants to achieve this integration. We term these approaches the generalist, specialist, and the hybrid approach.},

Next, we complete the U{\&}G framework with expectancy-value (EV) theory. EV theory helps us move from theoretical insights to concrete design guidelines. Together, the U{\&}G framework and the EV model form the foundation of our extended likeability framework for the design and evaluation of interactive media applications, for preschoolers in the home environment. Finally, we demonstrate a practical case of our extended likeability framework via the research project CuTI. The CuTI project aims at revealing those particular user gratifications and design attributes that are important to support playful behaviour and fun activities of preschoolers in the home environment.},

abstract = {Theory and research dealing with self‐regulation have focused primarily on instances of self‐regulation that involve high levels of self‐reflection and effortful self‐control. However, intentionally trying to control one's behavior sometimes reduces the likelihood of achieving one's goals. This article examines the process of hypo‐egoic self‐regulation in which people relinquish deliberate, conscious control over their own behavior so that they will respond more naturally, spontaneously, or automatically. An examination of spontaneously occurring hypo‐egoic states (such as flow, deindividuation, and transcendence) suggests that hypo‐egoic states are characterized by lowered self‐awareness and/or an increase in concrete and present‐focused self‐thoughts. In light of this, people may intentionally foster hypo‐egoism via two pathways—(a) taking steps to reduce the proportion of time that they are self‐aware (such as repeating a behavior until it is automatic or practicing meditation) or (b) increasing the concreteness of their self‐thoughts (such as inducing a concrete mindset or practicing mindfulness). In this way, people may deliberately choose to regulate hypo‐egoically when effortful control might be detrimental to their performance},

However, brainstorming has fallen into disfavor with many practitioners and researchers on the basis of such factors as the necessity for a skilled group leader, the potential for conflicts among members which can disrupt the process, and the possibility of one or more members dominating the discussion. Brainwriting, which is the silent, written generation of ideas by a group, is proposed as an alternative to brainstorming. Six different group brainiwriting techniques are described and suggestions given for the most appropriate use of each. It is concluded that both brainwriting and brainstorming will be useful in different situations and should be viewed as supplemental rather than primary sources of new product ideas. Furthermore, it is noted that idea generation is only part of the process. The best ideas in the world will be of little value if they are not implemented successfully.},

Despite the amazing results, the principle of neural style transfer, especially why the Gram matrices could represent style remains unclear. In this paper, we propose a novel interpretation of neural style transfer by treating it as a domain adaptation problem. Specifically, we theoretically show that matching the Gram matrices of feature maps is equivalent to minimize the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) with the second order polynomial kernel. Thus, we argue that the essence of neural style transfer is to match the feature distributions between the style images and the generated images. To further support our standpoint, we experiment with several other distribution alignment methods, and achieve appealing results. We believe this novel interpretation connects these two important research fields, and could enlighten future researches.},

These attributes are of interest because we do not have a concrete visual definition of what they entail. What does it look like for a dog to be more or less memorable? GANs allow us to generate a manifold of natural-looking images with fine-grained differences in their visual attributes. By navigating this manifold in directions that increase memorability, we can visualize what it looks like for a particular generated image to become more or less memorable. The resulting ``visual definitions" surface image properties (like ``object size") that may underlie memorability. Through behavioral experiments, we verify that our method indeed discovers image manipulations that causally affect human memory performance. We further demonstrate that the same framework can be used to analyze image aesthetics and emotional valence. Visit the GANalyze website at http://ganalyze.csail.mit.edu/.},

This growing awareness, that "good teamwork" increases the success of innovative projects, raises new questions: What is teamwork, and how can it be measured? Why and how is teamwork related to the success of innovative projects? How strong is the relationship between teamwork and various measures of project success such as performance or team member satisfaction? This article develops a comprehensive concept of the collaboration in teams, called Teamwork Quality (TWQ). The six facets of the TWQ construct, i.e., communication, coordination, balance of member contributions, mutual support, effort, and cohesion, are specified. Hypotheses regarding the relationship between TWQ and project success are tested using data from 575 team members, team leaders, and managers of 145 German software teams. The results of the structural equation models estimated show that TWQ (as rated by team members) is significantly associated with team performance as rated by team members, team leaders, and team-external managers. However, the magnitude of the relationship between TWQ and team performance varies by the perspective of the performance rater, i.e., manager vs. team leader vs. team members. Furthermore, TWQ shows a strong association with team members' personal success (i.e., work satisfaction and learning).},

abstract = {Consumer-oriented design has become a key element in a successful product development process. However, since consumers have constantly changing needs, their cognition toward a product is abstract and unclear, and designers do not have a method to effectively incorporate consumers' opinions during the design process. Designers and consumers have cognitive differences when it comes to the ‘meaning' of a product. The main purpose of this study is to develop a cognitive structure model in order to understand the differences and similarities between designers and consumers' cognitions, and furthermore to help designers obtain consensus with consumers on the meaning of a product. The first step in the procedure is to use mind mapping to present designers' cognition, and then an implication matrix to conduct research on consumers' cognition. Four areas (positive consensus, negative consensus, designer's subjectivity, and consumers' subjectivity) are defined based on the cognitive similarities and differences of designers and consumers. Finally, a streamlined hierarchical value map is used to present design guidelines. Through the case study on “beach toys design” and its process of developing design guidelines, it is proved that this cognitive structure model is operational and practical. Consequently, this model effectively enables designers and consumers to reach a common ground on product cognitions.},

Twitter language complexity, GDELT number of articles andWikipedia page reads have the highest predictive power. This study also allows a comparison of the different fore-sighting abilities of each platform, in terms of how many days ahead a platform can predict a price movement before it happens.

The phrases ended either congruously or with a nondiatonic, diatonic, or rhythmic violation. Percentage of correct responses was analyzed in Exp 1, and event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded in Exps 2 and 3. Musicians performed better than nonmusicians in recognizing familiar musical phrases and classifying terminal notes. The differences found as a function of expertise were larger for unfamiliar than for familiar melodies. The ERPs to the end notes differed both in terms of amplitude and latency between musicians and nonmusicians, and as a function of participants' familiarity with the melodies and type of violation. Results show that expertise influences the decisional rather than the purely perceptual aspects of music processing and that ERPs can provide important insight into the study of music perception.

abstract = {Variable importance (VI) tools describe how much covariates contribute to a prediction model's accuracy. However, important variables for one well-performing model (for example, a linear model f(x) = xT$\beta$ with a fixed coefficient vector $\beta$) may be unimportant for another model. In this paper, we propose model class reliance (MCR) as the range of VI values across all well-performing model in a prespecified class. Thus, MCR gives a more comprehensive description of importance by accounting for the fact that many prediction models, possibly of different parametric forms, may fit the data well. In the process of deriving MCR, we show several informative results for permutation-based VI estimates, based on the VI measures used in Random Forests. Specifically, we derive connections between permutation importance estimates for a single prediction model, U-statistics, conditional variable importance, conditional causal effects, and linear model coefficients. We then give probabilistic bounds for MCR, using a novel, generalizable technique. We apply MCR to a public data set of Broward County criminal records to study the reliance of recidivism prediction models on sex and race. In this application, MCR can be used to help inform VI for unknown, proprietary models.},

While a growing corpus of work has demonstrated the potentially deleterious effects of smartphone usage, relatively few studies have differentiated between addiction to the device versus addiction to social network services or measured the influence of user perceptions on smartphone addiction. To contribute to knowledge on this subject, the present study had three key aims. The first was to examine the differences between smartphone addiction and social network services addiction. The second aim was to understand the influence of user perceptions on addiction (measured through cognitive absorption to examine users' state of involvement and engagement with software and technology). Our final aim was to examine differences for demographic factors for smartphone and social networking services addiction and user perceptions. Based on a survey of business students at a university in the Mid-Atlantic region of United States, the results showed that addiction to smartphone devices is greater than addiction to social networking services and varies by educational attainment, while social networking services usage does not vary by gender, age or education. Further, users addicted to smartphones and social networking services experience higher levels of cognitive absorption, particularly by females when using social networking services and greater for social networking services than smartphones. Finally, we find that the impact of cognitive absorption on smartphone addiction is mediated by addiction to SNS services.},

I argue that metacognitive knowledge is multidimensional, domain-general in nature, and teachable. Four instructional strategies are described for promoting the construction and acquisition of metacognitive awareness. These include promoting general awareness, improving self-knowledge and regulatory skills, and promoting learning environments that are conducive to the construction and use of metacognition.},

abstract = {We introduce a new approach to monitoring the activity of smartphone users based on their physical interactions with the interface. Typical events are taps, scrolling and typing, carried out to interact with apps. As compared to other measures, this directly encapsulates potential problematic physical smartphone behaviour as a signal. The approach contrasts against conventions such as self-reporting or timing activity sessions, and it focusses on active rather than passive smartphone activity. Using this alternative method, we collected all user interface interaction events from a sample of 64 participants over a period of 8 weeks, using a bespoke monitoring app called Tymer. User Smartphone Addiction was seen to significantly correlate with high levels of interaction with Lifestyle apps, particularly for female users. Interactions with Social apps in general were also associated with Smartphone Addiction. In particular, user interactions with Snapchat correlated with Smartphone Addiction, represented across all types of interface interaction. This is significant given the widespread usage of Snapchat by teenagers, and we hypothesise that the app's design provides a particularly strong pathway in support of Smartphone Addiction.},

abstract = { The phenomenon of expertise produces two problems for liberal democratic theory: the first is whether it creates inequalities that undermine citizen rule or make it a sham; the second is whether the state can preserve its neutrality in liberal `government by discussion' while subsidizing, depending on, and giving special status to, the opinions of experts and scientists. A standard Foucauldian critique suggests that neutrality is impossible, expert power and state power are inseparable, and that expert power is the source of the oppressive, inegalitarian effects of present regimes. Habermas argues that expert cultures make democratic discussion impossible. Analogous problems arise with `cognitive authority', understood in Mertonian terms. Cognitive authority, as Merton sees it, allows us to ask about the democratic legitimacy of this authority, which appears to solve the problem (or part of the problem) because it returns ultimate `authority' to the people, who reject or accept the experts' claims. And many claims to expertise in fact do fail to gain acceptance. Through an examination of the type of expert that appears to evade the demands of legitimation, it is shown that expertise and liberal democracy can in principle co-exist, contrary to the claims of the critics. },

Data from 1, 177 public school teachers were used to test a model of union commitment in which alternative composite formation methods were used to specify the measurement components of the model. Bootstrapping procedures were used to generate data for two additional sample sizes. Results indicated that the use of composites, in general, resulted in improved overall model fit as compared to treating all items as individual indicators. Lambda values and explained criterion variance indicated that this improved model fit was due to the creation of strong measurement models. Implications of these results for researchers using composites are discussed.},

abstract = {The primary aim of the present study was to systematically compare perceived emotions in music using two different theoretical frameworks: the discrete emotion model, and the dimensional model of affect. A secondary aim was to introduce a new, improved set of stimuli for the study of music-mediated emotions. A large pilot study established a set of 110 film music excerpts, half were moderately and highly representative examples of five discrete emotions (anger, fear, sadness, happiness and tenderness), and the other half moderate and high examples of the six extremes of three bipolar dimensions (valence, energy arousal and tension arousal). These excerpts were rated in a listening experiment by 116 non-musicians. All target emotions of highly representative examples in both conceptual sets were discriminated by self-ratings. Linear mapping techniques between the discrete and dimensional models revealed a high correspondence along two central dimensions that can be labelled as valence and arousal, and the three dimensions could be reduced to two without significantly reducing the goodness of fit. The major difference between the discrete and categorical models concerned the poorer resolution of the discrete model in characterizing emotionally ambiguous examples. The study offers systematically structured and rich stimulus material for exploring emotional processing.},

In pace with a global deluge of videos from billions of computers, smartphones, tablets, university projectors and security cameras, the amount of multimodal content on the Web has been growing exponentially, and with that comes the need for decoding such information into useful knowledge. In this paper, a multimodal affective data analysis framework is proposed to extract user opinion and emotions from video content. In particular, multiple kernel learning is used to combine visual, audio and textual modalities. The proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art model in multimodal sentiment analysis research with a margin of 10–13{\%} and 3–5{\%} accuracy on polarity detection and emotion recognition, respectively. The paper also proposes an extensive study on decision-level fusion. },

Overall, we obtained a negative mean correlation between each job performance measure and each stressor included in our analyses. As hypothesized, role ambiguity and situational constraints were most strongly negatively related to performance, relative to the other work-related stressors. Analysis of moderators revealed that (a) the negative correlation of role overload and performance was higher among managers relative to nonmanagers; (b) publication year moderated the relation of role ambiguity and role overload with performance, although in opposite directions; (c) the correlations obtained for published versus unpublished studies were not significantly different; and (d) using the Rizzo et al. scale of role ambiguity and role conflict decreased the magnitude of the correlations of these stressors with performance, relative to other scales.

We discuss the SDT concept of needs as it relates to previous need theories, emphasizing that needs specify the necessary conditions for psycholog-ical growth, integrity, and well-being. This concept of needs leads to the hypotheses that different regulatory processes underlying goal pursuits are differentially associ-ated with effective functioning and well-being and also that different goal contents have different relations to the quality of behavior and mental health, specifically be-cause different regulatory processes and different goal contents are associated with differing degrees of need satisfaction. Social contexts and individual differences that support satisfaction of the basic needs facilitate natural growth processes including intrinsically motivated behavior and integration of extrinsic motivations, whereas those that forestall autonomy, competence, or relatedness are associated with poorer motivation, performance, and well-being. We also discuss the relation of the psycho-logical needs to cultural values, evolutionary processes, and other contemporary mo-tivation theories.},

understanding - problem solving - definition
In problem-solving research, the term understanding mean that you have constructued a mental representation of the problem, based on the information provided in the problem and your own previous experience (Robertson, 2001). In order to understand a problem, you need to construct an accurate mental representation (Greeno, 1977, 1991).

situated-cognition approach - ecological validity - relevance
The traditional cognitive approach to thinking emphasizes the processes that take place inside an individual person's head. The situated-cognition approach argues that the traditional cognitive approach is too simplistic, because in real life, our cognitive processes take advantage of an information-rich environment, supplemented by complex social interactions with other people (Greeno et al., 1998; Olson {\{}{\&}{\}}amp; Olson, 2003). [...] This situated-cognition perspective is consistent with the idea that psychologists should emphasize ecological validity if they want to accurately understand cognitive processes. [...] a study has ecological validity if the conditions in which the research is conducted are similar to the natural setting in which the results will be applied.

p. 372 problem solving - hill-climbing heuristic - critique
The hill-climbing heuristic can be useful when you cannot discover sufficient information about your alternatives - when you can see only the immediate next step (Dunbar, 1998). However, like many heuristics, the hill-climbing heuristic can lead you astray. The bigggest drawback to this heuristic is that problem solvers must consistently choose the alternative that appears to lead most directly toward the goal. In doing so, they may fail to choose a less direct alternative, which may have greater long-term benefits. [...] (Robertson, 2001).
[?] the important point to remember about the hill-climbing heurisitc is that it encourages short-term goals, rather than long-term solutions.
/*** USE in dissertation - introduction - agile methods
agile methods resemble rather hill-climbing on dynamically evolving slope since means-end heuristic assumes the existence of a static definition of the goal state (of a problem), equal to a final requirement definition (of a software product), which can be broken down to smaller subgoals, i.e. releases. Typically, agile methods are applied in environments in which the goal is constantly evolving (moving target), so hill-climbing will be more efficient than means-end heuristic.
***/
==
p.373 problem solving - means-ends heuristic - concept
The means-ends heuristic has tow important components: (1) First you divide the problem into a number of subproblems, [?] and (2) then you try to reduce the difference between the initial state and the goal state for each of the subproblems. The name means-ends heuristic is appropriate because it requires you to identify the {\{}{\&}{\}}quot;ends{\{}{\&}{\}}quot; you want and then figrue out the {\{}{\&}{\}}quot;means{\{}{\&}{\}}quot; you will use to reach those end.s The menas-ends heuristic focuses the problem solver's attention on the difference between the initial problem state and the goal state. This heuristic is more sophisticated than the hill-climbing heuristic, and it is one of the most effective and flexible problem-solving strategies (Dunbar, 1998; Lovett, 2002).
==
p. 375 problem solving - means-ends heuristic - limitation
Contemporary cognitive scientists also acknowledge that people often solve ill-defined problems, where the goal is not obvious; means-ends analysis is therefore not useful (Sobel, 2001)
==
p. 376f problem solving - analogy - relevance
Analogies also figure prominently in creative breakthroughs in domains such as art, science, and politics (Blanchette {\{}{\&}{\}}amp; Dunbar, 2000; Dunbar, 2001; Robertson, 2001). When we use the analogy approach in problem solving, we use asolution to a similar, earlier problem to help solve a new one.
[... ]
The major barrier to using the analogy aproach, however, is that people [?] pay more attention to the obvious surface features, the specific objects and terms used in teh question. [?] fail to emphasize the structural features, the underlying core that must be understood in order to solve the problem correctly. [...] As emphasized by the situated-cognition perspective (pp. 369-370), people often have trouble solving the same problem in a new setting; they fail to transfer tehir knowledge.

abstract = {Real-time captioning provides deaf and hard of hearing peo- ple immediate access to spoken language and enables partic- ipation in dialogue with others. Low latency is critical be- cause it allows speech to be paired with relevant visual cues. Currently, the only reliable source of real-time captions are expensive stenographers who must be recruited in advance and who are trained to use specialized keyboards. Automatic speech recognition (ASR) is less expensive and available on- demand, but its low accuracy, high noise sensitivity, and need for training beforehand render it unusable in real-world situ- ations. In this paper, we introduce a new approach in which groups of non-expert captionists (people who can hear and type) collectively caption speech in real-time on-demand. We present LEGION:SCRIBE, an end-to-end system that allows deaf people to request captions at any time. We introduce an algorithm for merging partial captions into a single out- put stream in real-time, and a captioning interface designed to encourage coverage of the entire audio stream. Evaluation with 20 local participants and 18 crowd workers shows that non-experts can provide an effective solution for captioning, accurately covering an average of 93.2{\%} of an audio stream with only 10 workers and an average per-word latency of 2.9 seconds. More generally, our model in which multiple work- ers contribute partial inputs that are automatically merged in real-time may be extended to allow dynamic groups to sur- pass constituent individuals (even experts) on a variety of hu- man performance tasks.},

Hierarchical cluster analysis and estimates of general factor saturation suggested the presence of a weak general factor, as well as 3 subordinate clusters. The 3-cluster subscales (Social Vitality, Mood Volatility, and Excitement) were moderately correlated but conceptually distinct and were correlated in opposing patterns with a range of personality and psychopathology measures. Results show that cluster subscales suppress total score associations with validity measures.

Understanding and fixing errors that arise in such integrative systems is difficult as failures can occur at multiple points in the execution workflow. Moreover, errors can propagate, become amplified or be suppressed, making blame assignment difficult. We propose a human-in-the-loop methodology which leverages human intellect for troubleshooting system failures. The approach simulates potential component fixes through human computation tasks and measures the expected improvements in the holistic behavior of the system. The method provides guidance to designers about how they can best improve the system. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach on an automated image captioning system that has been pressed into real-world use.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright}2018 The Psychonomic Society, Inc. Psychophysical procedures are applied in various fields to assess sensory thresholds. During experiments, sampled psychometric functions are usually assumed to be stationary. However, perception can be altered, for example by loss of attention to the presentation of stimuli, leading to biased data, which results in poor threshold estimates. The few existing approaches attempting to identify non-stationarities either detect only whether there was a change in perception, or are not suitable for experiments with a relatively small number of trials (e.g., (Formula presented.) 300). We present a method to detect inattention periods on a trial-by-trial basis with the aim of improving threshold estimates in psychophysical experiments using the adaptive sampling procedure Parameter Estimation by Sequential Testing (PEST). The performance of the algorithm was evaluated in computer simulations modeling inattention, and tested in a behavioral experiment on proprioceptive difference threshold assessment in 20 stroke patients, a population where attention deficits are likely to be present. Simulations showed that estimation errors could be reduced by up to 77{\%} for inattentive subjects, even in sequences with less than 100 trials. In the behavioral data, inattention was detected in 14{\%} of assessments, and applying the proposed algorithm resulted in reduced test–retest variability in 73{\%} of these corrected assessments pairs. The novel algorithm complements existing approaches and, besides being applicable post hoc, could also be used online to prevent collection of biased data. This could have important implications in assessment practice by shortening experiments and improving estimates, especially for clinical settings.},

abstract = {In this work, we explore the problem of generating fantastic special-effects for the typography. It is quite challenging due to the model diversities to illustrate varied text effects for different characters. To address this issue, our key idea is to exploit the analytics on the high regularity of the spatial distribution for text effects to guide the synthesis process. Specifically, we characterize the stylized patches by their normalized positions and the optimal scales to depict their style elements. Our method first estimates these two features and derives their correlation statistically. They are then converted into soft constraints for texture transfer to accomplish adaptive multi-scale texture synthesis and to make style element distribution uniform. It allows our algorithm to produce artistic typography that fits for both local texture patterns and the global spatial distribution in the example. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method for various text effects over conventional style transfer methods. In addition, we validate the effectiveness of our algorithm with extensive artistic typography library generation.},

@article{Matta2015,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The relationship of serum lipoprotein lipids and apolipoproteins to obesity was studied in a biracial sample of 2,816 children of ages 5-17 in Bogalusa, Louisiana. METHODS: Two measures of obesity were used: fatness (subscapular skinfold thickness) and fat centrality (the ratio of subscapular to triceps skinfold thickness). Plasma insulin and glucose were included as metabolic markers related to obesity. RESULTS: The obesity associations were relatively strong with insulin (rs = 0.29, P less than 0.001, skinfold; rs = 0.15, P less than 0.001, skinfold ratio) and triglycerides (rs = 0.25, P less than 0.001, skinfold; rs = 0.19, P less than 0.001, skinfold ratio). The relationships of serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (rs = 0.17, P less than 0.001, skinfold; rs = 0.13, P less than 0.001, skinfold ratio) and apolipoprotein (apo) B (rs = 0.16, P less than 0.001, skinfold; rs = 0.13, P less than 0.001, skinfold ratio) with the obesity measures were of lesser magnitude, but persisted after adjustment for insulin and triglycerides. The inverse association of obesity to serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (rs = -0.13, P less than 0.001, both skinfold and skinfold ratio) and apo A-I (rs = -0.04, P = 0.03, skinfold; rs = -0.05, P = 0.004, skinfold ratio) was significant only before adjustment for insulin and serum triglycerides. Multiple linear regression of obesity measures showed that, like insulin, serum triglycerides had consistently higher standardized coefficients than LDL-C, HDL-C, apo B, and apo A-I. Apo A-I and apo B added only a small amount (less than 2{\%}) of information to the relationship of serum lipoproteins with obesity measures. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that serum very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) levels are directly and independently related to obesity. The well-known inverse association between obesity and serum HDL-C is not independent, but secondary to the elevated VLDL or triglyceride levels associated with obesity. While associations of obesity and lipoprotein cholesterol are found, far fewer occur with apolipoproteins, especially Apo A-I. Interesting race and sex differences in the relationship of obesity to serum lipoproteins and apoproteins are noted, being greater among white children and more consistent in white males.},

Here, Nigel Cross takes up the arguments for a 'third area' of education -design -that were outlined by Archer. He further defines this area by contrasting it with the other two -sciences and humanities -and goes on to consider the criteria which design must satisfy to be acceptable must imply a reorientation from the instrumental aims of conventional design education, towards intrinsic values. These values derive from the 'designerly ways of knowing'. Because of a common concern with these fundamental 'ways of knowing', both design research and design education are contributing to the development of design as a discipline.},

abstract = {Categorical data fields characterized by a large number of distinct values represent a serious challenge for many classification and regression algorithms that require numerical inputs. On the other hand, these types of data fields are quite common in real-world data mining applications and often contain potentially relevant information that is difficult to represent for modeling purposes. This paper presents a simple preprocessing scheme for high-cardinality categorical data that allows this class of attributes to be used in predictive models such as neural networks, linear and logistic regression. The proposed method is based on a well-established statistical method (empirical Bayes) that is straightforward to implement as an in-database procedure. Furthermore, for categorical attributes with an inherent hierarchical structure, like ZIP codes, the preprocessing scheme can directly leverage the hierarchy by blending statistics at the various levels of aggregation. While the statistical methods discussed in this paper were first introduced in the mid 1950' s, the use of these methods as a preprocessing step for complex models, like neural networks, has not been previously discussed in any literature.},

The strongest unique predictors of current happiness were Mental Control (inversely related), Direct Attempts, Affiliation, Religion, Partying, and Active Leisure. Gender differences suggest that men prefer to engage in Active Leisure and Mental Control, whereas women favor Affiliation, Goal Pursuit, Passive Leisure, and Religion. Relative to Asian and Chicano(a) stu- dents, White students preferred using high arousal strategies.

Since institutes exist that focus on teaching design thinking, the question arises what the experts of education believe they achieve with their lessons and how they support students in developing a capability of thinking and acting creative. In the empirical part of this study we find that there are different levels of creative knowledge, skills and mindsets that can be achieved by design thinking education, culminating in a capability that is called 'creative confidence'. Building on these results we demonstrate how design education contributes to both the development and understanding of design creativity. Furthermore we suggest a definition of " design thinking " as a learning model towards creative confidence.},

This work discusses the functionality of mental models (cognitive structures) in managerial decision making in the context of organizational growth, strategy development and the development of organizational learning. The conceptualization is based on literature springing from theories of learning, cognition, and strategy development to propose the Process of Environmental Scanning, Interpretation and Strategic Action used by managers, and promotes the investigation of the applicability of such a concept in business networks. The paper concludes that the cognitive approach and the use of mental models can enhance our understanding of how strategic decisions become a function of mental models used by managers.},

The polarization proposed by Papanek, between industrial production in developed countries and local production in developing countries, did not help design to become a critical element of development policies. This polarization, in fact, reflects the general view of design—associated with industrial production, and therefore not suitable for the implementation of development policies (although Papanek is clearly contrasting this view).3},

Money is often concentrated on a single victim even though more people would be helped, if resources were dispersed or spent protecting future victims. We examine the impact of deliberating about donation decisions on generosity. In a series of field experiments, we show that teaching or priming people to recognize the discrepancy in giving toward identifiable and statistical victims has perverse effects: individuals give less to identifiable victims but do not increase giving to statistical victims, resulting in an overall reduction in caring and giving. Thus, it appears that, when thinking deliberatively, people discount sympathy towards identifiable victims but fail to generate sympathy toward statistical victims.},

@article{Carre2013,
abstract = {Initially thought of as a unitary ability, empathy has been more recently considered to consist of 2 components (i.e., an affective and a cognitive component). The Basic Empathy Scale (BES) is a tool that has been used to assess empathy in young people and adolescents on the basis of this dual-component conception (Jolliffe {\&} Farrington, 2006). Recent studies of empathy have led to it being defined as underpinned by 3 components, namely, emotional contagion, emotional disconnection, and cognitive empathy. The aims of this study were (a) to validate the BES in Adults and (b) to compare the different conceptions of empathy. Three hundred seventy French adults took part in the study, and 160 of them filled out complementary scales measuring empathy, alexithymia, and emotional consciousness. The confirmatory factor analyses showed that the 3-factor model was the model that was best able to account for the data. Complementary tools confirmed the relationships previously observed between empathy as assessed with the BES and other scales assessing emotional processes. The results of this study make it clear that empathy can be seen as process-dependent. This conception of empathy, which is based on 3 factors, is consistent with the current, more integrated view of empathy. The implications of this conception and the opportunity to use the 2 or 3 factors of the BES in adults are presented in the discussion.},

For both methods, asymptotic covariance matrices for estimates are derived, and the methods are illustrated and compared with artificial and real data.},

abstract = {In order to create an "in-the-wild" dataset of facial emotions with large number of balanced samples, this paper proposes a game-based data collection framework. The framework mainly include three components: a game engine, a game interface, and a data collection and evaluation module. We use a deep learning approach to build an emotion classifier as the game engine. Then a emotion web game to allow gamers to enjoy the games, while the data collection module obtains automatically-labelled emotion images. Using our game, we have collected more than 15,000 images within a month of the test run and built an emotion dataset "GaMo". To evaluate the dataset, we compared the performance of two deep learning models trained on both GaMo and CIFE. The results of our experiments show that because of being large and balanced, GaMo can be used to build a more robust emotion detector than the emotion detector trained on CIFE, which was used in the game engine to collect the face images.},

Participants engaged in a depleting task for either a short or a long period of time. They then performed a weapon identification task, which served as a measure of race stereotyping. Analyses guided by the L.L. Jacoby's (1991) process dissociation procedure indicated that ego-depletion reduced the controlled component of responses, but did not affect the automatic component. Further, ego-depletion increased stereotypical responses only among those participants who showed strong automatic stereotype activation. The discussion focuses on methodologically and theoretically integrating notions of self-control and cognitive control.},

abstract = {Procrastination is a prevalent and pernicious form of self-regulatory failure that is not entirely understood. Hence, the relevant conceptual, theoretical, and empirical work is reviewed, drawing upon correlational, experimental, and qualitative findings. A meta-analysis of procrastination's possible causes and effects, based on 691 correlations, reveals that neuroticism, rebelliousness, and sensation seeking show only a weak connection. Strong and consistent predictors of procrastination were task aversiveness, task delay, self-efficacy, and impulsiveness, as well as conscientiousness and its facets of self-control, distractibility, organization, and achievement motivation. These effects prove consistent with temporal motivation theory, an integrative hybrid of expectancy theory and hyperbolic discounting. Continued research into procrastination should not be delayed, especially because its prevalence appears to be growing.},
